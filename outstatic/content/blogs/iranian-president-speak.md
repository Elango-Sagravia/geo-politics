### Iranian President Speaks at the General Assembly

The UN General Assembly debates began on Tuesday and will continue the following Monday. On the first day of debates, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian delivered a speech that [prompted](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/thousands-rally-outside-un-general-174334325.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE98yJBmFWCtbTo4qcuiNnRJDkfqx-k4J64OsYA2BUB9HhsLejXEuu0V1cNXr5rtin9eiI7J7dOmPnZzvYf3jdGCNO4bs49DvhPCXQK1zhsn7FFTr17SLBWbOvRLvKa9j91qQQQWZLK7xvQWcgirnLVt4DnfemdNz9kerLUqr6GJ) many protests from various Iranian Americans. President Pezeshkian’s speech highlighted Iran's openness to reviving the 2015 Nuclear Deal and criticized Former President Trump for canceling it during his presidency. On Monday, he also gave a speech [criticizing](https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-iran-529d09bced2d3c579df5ab025b467a55) the UN for its “inaction” against Israel, calling it “senseless and incomprehensible” amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.

Coincidentally, just days earlier, Reza Pahlavi, the son of the ousted Shah of Iran and former U.S. President Donald Trump, [spoke](https://x.com/PahlaviReza/status/1838217962471186575?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) at an Israeli-American Council Summit. Their involvement underscores the sharp polarization within the Persian community, both in terms of Iran's political future and its relationship with the West.

The Iranian diaspora remains divided. Many oppose the current Iranian regime but also have complicated views about the Shah's legacy. Trump's presidency created further division, with some Iranian-Americans feeling alienated while others see the Republican Party as a more forceful adversary to Iran’s government than the Democrats. This dynamic has left parts of the community feeling conflicted, torn between competing global narratives and political interests concerning Iran.

### The Czech President Believes Russia Will Still Control Part of Ukraine

![Czech President Petr Pavel said Ukraine might need to accept temporary Russian occupation](/images/the-czech-president-believes-russia-will-still-control-ukraine-whenever-the-war-ends-YwNj.webp)

Czech President Petr Pavel [stated](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-czech-republic-russia-vladimir-putin-petr-pavel/) that Kyiv must accept that part of Ukraine may temporarily remain under Russian occupation, even if the war ends. In an interview, he mentioned that this occupation could last for years. Pavel emphasized that neither Ukraine nor Russia can achieve their ideological goals, believing that a definitive defeat for either side is unlikely.

As the United Nations General Assembly convenes, Ukraine remains a crucial topic. Pavel has previously stated that any peace deal will likely be unfair. The Czech Republic is one of Ukraine’s most prominent supporters in the European Union. However, some regional elections saw [gains](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/22/main-opposition-party-dominates-regional-elections-in-the-czech-republic) from a right-wing populist party, which could signal Czech frustration with the government’s unconditional support.

### Sweden Accuses Iran of Instigating

Swedish authorities recently accused Iran of [orchestrating](https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/24/sweden-says-iran-was-behind-thousands-of-text-messages-inciting-protests-over-quran-burnin) a cyberattack that bombarded the country with thousands of text messages demanding revenge for the Quran burnings in 2023. Officials claim Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard hacked into an SMS service to send approximately 15,000 messages in Swedish related to the public burnings that occurred that summer. Senior prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist stated that preliminary investigations connected the Iranian state and its Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to this breach.

While Iran's official foreign policy promotes non-intervention, it opposes Western interference, primarily regarding the Middle East rather than domestic affairs. Recently, though, the US has also accused Iran of relaying confidential information about some of Trump’s strategies to the Biden campaign.

### Egypt Gives Somalia Weapons with Rising Tensions with Ethiopia

An Egyptian ship [delivered](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglk038p1d3o) a significant shipment of military equipment to Somalia. Somali Defence Minister Abdulkadir Mohamed Nu thanked Egypt on social media but did not specify the types of weapons. This is Egypt's second delivery in a month amid deteriorating relations between Somalia and Ethiopia. Ethiopia expressed concerns about the arms potentially empowering militants, while Somaliland warned of an arms race in the fragile environment.

Ethiopian and Somali relations have been complex and often strained. Ethiopia and Somalia also have a long-standing rivalry, particularly over water rights. Military cooperation between Egypt and Somalia, including arms deliveries, has worsened these tensions, leading to regional stability and potential conflict concerns.

### Sinola Cartel War Continues to Wage in Mexico

The ongoing war between Sinaloa Cartel factions has [spread](https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-09-24/cartel-war-in-sinaloa-spreads-fear-to-other-states-in-mexico-you-see-fewer-people-on-the-streets-and-businesses-close-early.html) violence across northern Mexico, affecting states like Sonora, Baja California, Chihuahua, and Durango. Over 60 deaths have been reported, causing widespread panic, business closures, and school disruptions.

A lawyer’s death during an army operation has further eroded community trust. Citizens are deeply concerned about their safety and livelihoods. Mexican President López Obrador blamed U.S. operations for contributing to the violence, which intensified after the arrest of two cartel leaders in the U.S. last July. The US ambassador has rejected the accusation. The violence shows no signs of slowing, leaving the region in turmoil.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is Transnistria?**

![Transnistria is an unrecognized republic reliant on Russian support](/images/what-is-transnistria--Y0Mj.webp)

Transnistria, also known as the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR), is a breakaway, self-proclaimed republic between the Dniester River and Moldova's eastern border with Ukraine. It takes on the role of a de facto state. It has a government, bureaucracy, and even its own money. However, legally, it is part of Moldova. The international community does not recognize Transnistria. Russia does not even recognize it.

Transnistria declared independence from Moldova in 1990 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. While Russia does not legally recognize it, it supports it militarily and economically. Russia has focused much of its attention on Ukraine, but Transnistria remains a vital entity that helps Russia prevent Moldova's geopolitical direction from drifting more toward the West.

The conflict stems from ethnic and political divisions between Transnistria's predominantly Russian-speaking population and Moldova's government, which sought closer ties with Romania after independence. A short but intense war broke out in 1992 between Transnistrian separatists, backed by Russian forces, and the Moldovan army. The conflict ended in a ceasefire, but Transnistria's status remains unresolved.
