### Rutte Affirms NATO Support in Kyiv

![Rutte Affirms NATO Support in Kyiv](/images/nato-chief-mark-rutte-reaffirms-support-for-ukraine-in-kyiv-trip-Q4ND.webp)

NATO’s new Secretary-General, Mark Rutte, visited Kyiv to show strong support for Ukraine and stress NATO’s commitment to helping Ukraine win against Russia. While Rutte pledged ongoing backing, President Zelensky voiced [frustration over delays](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-western-allies-take-key-decisions-on-military-support-for-ukraine-too-long/) in Western military aid, especially long-range weapons, and called on NATO to do more to defend against Russian missiles and drones.

Meanwhile, Russia's [capture of Vugledar](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/02/europe/vuhledar-russia-ukraine-war-capture-intl/index.html) raises concerns about Ukraine's ability to hold off Russian advances as winter approaches. Amid shifting global politics, there are growing concerns about how long Ukraine can count on Western support. In Europe, support is waning in circles, particularly on the far left and right. On German reunification day, [left-wing groups protested](https://www.dw.com/en/german-far-left-groups-lead-berlin-peace-demonstration/a-70396065) against aid to Ukraine, while the right-wing leaders expressed a desire to restore relations with Russia eventually.

### EU Sues Hungary

The European Union is taking Hungary to the European Court of Justice over laws introduced by Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government, which the EU says violate fundamental rights. These [laws](https://apnews.com/article/hungary-sovereignty-law-media-orban-government-critics-205b5cfffa0c750b3eb8092ea428d5c6), passed last year, restrict foreign funding in election campaigns and give a new Sovereignty Protection Office broad investigative powers, which critics claim are used to silence opposition. Despite earlier warnings from the EU, Hungary refused to amend the legislation, escalating tensions between Orban’s government and the European Commission. The court can impose penalties and enforce compliance with EU law.

Hungary is already facing penalties for non-compliance with EU migration policies, fined $200 million ([see previous issue](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/kashmir-elections)). Orbán’s government has also faced criticism for cracking down on media freedoms, including forcing a major [university to relocate to Vienna](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54433398). Hungary's relationship with the EU remains fraught, with Orbán often clashing with Brussels over issues like rule of law and support for Ukraine.

**French Jihadist Sentenced to Life for Role in Charlie Hebdo Attacks**

Peter Cherif, a French jihadist connected to the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attacks, was [sentenced to life](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241003-french-jihadist-linked-to-charlie-hebdo-attackers-sentenced-to-life-in-prison) imprisonment by a Paris court on October 3. Cherif, 42, was found guilty of belonging to a terrorist organization while fighting for Al-Qaeda in Yemen from 2011 to 2018, during which he allegedly trained Chérif Kouachi, one of the attackers. 

Prosecutors labeled him a key figure in the planning of the [Charlie Hebdo massacre](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30708237) and noted his involvement in the hostage-taking of French aid workers. Despite denying involvement in the attack, he received a minimum of 22 years before potential parole. France has problems with citizens showing [sympathy for jihadist groups](https://www.politico.eu/article/isis-propaganda-france-intelligence-radicalisation-teenagers/). While many blame migration, it is shown that most of those guilty of joining the groups are often 2nd or 3rd generation French citizens. This reflects on French society in dealing with the post-colonial hangover and disenfranchisement many young people of immigrant background have with French society. On the other hand, radicalization among those on the [far right](https://www.politico.eu/article/far-right-europe-young-voters-election-2024-foreigners-out-generation-france-germany/) has also increased among the younger generations. 

**Dominican Republic to Deport Thousands of Haitians**

The Dominican Republic plans to deport up to 10,000 undocumented [Haitian migrants](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20jepjrx74o) weekly, citing an “excess” of migrants and increased gang violence in Haiti. Government spokesman Homero Figueroa criticized the international community for its slow response to the crisis, asserting that the deportations would adhere to human rights protocols. Despite these assurances, critics argue that the Abinader administration has treated Haitian migrants inhumanely.

The announcement highlights frustrations over the ongoing humanitarian crisis, as [gangs control much of Haiti](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/13/who-are-haitis-gangs-and-what-do-they-want-all-you-need-to-know), exacerbating conditions for those fleeing violence. Haitian and Dominican relations have always been shaky. The Dominican Republic is Haiti’s second-largest trading partner after the US. Still, the two countries have had shared [hostilities](https://theconversation.com/haitians-looking-to-escape-violence-and-chaos-face-hostility-in-neighboring-dominican-republic-228261) due to substantial ethnic and cultural differences, historical conflicts, territorial disputes, and sharing the island of Hispaniola.

**Slovak PM Wants To Restore Russian Relations**

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has pledged to restore economic [relations with Russia](https://tvpworld.com/82656779/slovakian-pm-vows-to-restore-relations-with-russia-once-ukraine-war-ends) if the war in Ukraine ends during his term. Despite pressure from the European Commission, Fico supports continuing to buy Russian gas and oil, emphasizing Slovakia’s need to maintain transit routes through Ukraine. He also criticized alternative suppliers for only increasing costs without changing the source. 

Fico’s comments come amid concerns about Ukraine’s potential non-renewal of an essential [gas transit deal](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2024/02/the-final-countdown-will-russia-and-ukraine-renew-gas-transit-deal?lang=en) with Russia at the end of the year. Fico’s pro-Russian stance, alongside Hungary, has drawn criticism within the EU, particularly after Ukraine [blocked the transit of Russian oil](https://english.nv.ua/nation/naftogaz-comments-on-transit-of-russian-oil-through-ukraine-50455941.html) earlier this year. Hungary has also been criticized for trying to normalize things with Russia by [simplifying the visa scheme](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/04/eu-and-hungarian-officials-trade-barbs-over-visa-scheme-for-russian-citizens) for Russian citizens last month. 

### FOUNDATIONS

**German Reunification**

![German Reunification](/images/_what-has-germany-achieved-since-unification-kyND.webp)

The [reunification of Germany](https://www.usip.org/publications/2021/02/german-reunification-it-was-nothing-short-miracle), finalized on October 3, 1990, was a monumental event rooted in decades of division following World War II. After the war, Germany was split into East and West, reflecting broader geopolitical tensions during the Cold War. East Germany, a socialist state backed by the Soviet Union, faced economic struggles and political repression, leading to civil unrest and mass protests in 1989.

The reunification profoundly influenced Europe’s political landscape, leading to the expansion of the European Union and solidifying Germany’s role as a key player on the continent. Today, the legacy of German reunification continues to shape discussions around national identity, economic equity, and democratic governance in the context of global political dynamics.

Germans from the former West and East still harbor resentments against each other; East Germans blamed capitalists for losing jobs and income, while West Germans resented the East for slowing the economy. The economic factors have taken a long time to reconcile. There is still a lot of economic disparity from the former East. The former East has more barriers to adapting to a multicultural society. They missed the Post-World War 2 construction era, which brought in guest workers from Turkey and the Mediterranean. The most exposure to foreigners they had before reunification was international students from other communist nations. The former East still votes far right at much higher rates than the West.
