### North Korea tests out new drones

![North Korea tests drones, Pakistan separatists kill 31](/images/27th-aug--north-korea-tests-drones--no-ceasefire--separatists-in-pakistan-kill-31-gyMz.jpg)

Last weekend, North Korea tested out a series of new [drones, ](https://apnews.com/article/korea-kim-jong-un-suicide-drones-922a06354df8d10cb778e503632fe9f2)one of which has been coined as a suicide drone. Photos show a white drone with X-shaped tails and wings supposedly crashing into and destroying a target that resembles South Korea’s main battle tank. These tests followed the US and South Korean Ulchi freedom drills last week. The U.S. and South Korea have joint drills each summer to prepare for a future North Korean attack. Kim Jong Un also says he is planning for one to react underwater. Usually, North Korea reacts similarly yearly to the joint South Korean and US military exercises, so this isn’t new.

### No ceasefire agreement in Cairo

This round of ceasefire [talks ](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/25/gaza-ceasefire-hopes-hang-in-balance-as-hamas-delegation-leaves-cairo)is proving to be empty-handed. The Hamas delegation left Cairo with little results. Hamas rejected the new Israeli conditions and wants to continue the previous US-proposed deal. The main point of contention was an Israeli presence in the Philadelphi Corridor, a narrow 14.5km-long (9-mile-long) stretch of land along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt. The best that might come out is a smaller prisoner-hostage swap.  The U.S. delegation is getting more frustrated with this. Secretary of State Blinken and another US envoy have said this might be the last chance.  In addition, reports were coming out last week that former President Trump has been speaking with Nethanyhu to try to hinder a deal.

Gunmen in southwestern[ Pakistan](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/26/g-s1-19547/gunmen-attacks-southwestern-pakistan) killed at least 31 people in two separate attacks on Monday. This part of Pakistan is known as Baluchistan, and it has quite a few different separatist groups. This area is no stranger to attacks; however, Monday was the deadliest. Twenty-three people were fatally shot after being identified and taken from buses, vehicles, and trucks. In a separate attack, gunmen killed at least nine people, four police officers and five passersby. A railway and vehicles were also burned in these attacks. The Baluch Liberation Army, a group that seeks independence from Pakistan, is the likely culprit.

### **Tunisian president changes the parliament around**

The [Tunisian](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/tunisians-protest-against-presidents-power-grab-opposition-deepens-2021-09-26/) president, Kais Saied, announced that he would make some changes in Tunisia’s parliament. The changes result from Tunisia’s financial crisis and dissatisfaction over constant water and electricity outages in many parts of the country. The goal is also to have fresh blood before the elections in October. The opposition says this is just a way to pass blame and secure the way to reelection. Kais Saied announced that he would be seeking a new term this year. He became president in 2021 after what many say was a power grab. His rise to power made many demonstrate all over Tunisia, particularly in the capital of Tunis.

### **Rohingya seek an end to violence**

This week marks the 7th anniversary of the exodus of the [Rohingya f](https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/rohingya-refugees-in-bangladesh-hold-rallies-in-camps-demand-end-to-violence-safe-return-to-myanmar20240826131441/)rom Myanmar. The Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh held demonstrations to demand their safe return back to Myanmar. 750,000 fled from Myanmar in 2017. More have since also fled, particularly in the last few weeks, as things have heated back again in the Rakhine state of Western Myanmar. Fighting has increased between the military junta of Myanmar and the Aarakan army, which is an ethnonationalism group in the Rakhine state. Many of the remaining Rohingya have been stuck in the crossfire. The Rohingya have not been close with the Myanmar military government, which overthrew the democratic government in 2021; they suffer more from the Arakan Army.
