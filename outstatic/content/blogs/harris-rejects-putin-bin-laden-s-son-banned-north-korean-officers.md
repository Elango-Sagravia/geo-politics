### Kamala Harris Won’t Meet with Putin 

Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris stated her stance on potential peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a recent interview with CBS's "60 Minutes," she asserted that she would [refuse to engage in discussions with Putin](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241008-kamala-harris-says-she-would-not-meet-with-putin-if-ukraine-is-not-represented) unless Ukraine were part of the negotiations, emphasizing the need for Ukraine to have a direct say in its future. Harris also took the opportunity to criticize Donald Trump's approach to the conflict, calling it a ["surrender" ](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/17/whats-donald-trumps-plan-to-end-russias-war-on-ukraine)to Russian aggression.

She expressed concerns that Trump's presidency could have led to Russia gaining control over significant parts of Ukraine; Harris highlighted the importance of supporting Ukraine amid its ongoing efforts to join NATO and indicated that she would address this issue when appropriate. This dialogue underscores the stark differences in foreign policy perspectives between Harris and Trump, particularly regarding U.S. support for Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict with Russia.

### Omar Bin Laden Banned From France

Omar bin Laden, son of Osama bin Laden, was deported from France over allegations of [glorifying terrorism on social media](https://x.com/BrunoRetailleau/status/1843519627546001783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1843519627546001783%7Ctwgr%5Eadcf3a19227d1c0482f9d49e6179db1cf7473e39%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bfmtv.com%2Fpolitique%2Fgouvernement%2Fbruno-retailleau-prononce-une-interdiction-administrative-du-territoire-contre-le-fils-aine-d-oussama-ben-laden_AN-202410080172.html). The accusations stem from a controversial tweet posted in May 2023 that reportedly praised terrorists as martyrs. His appeal against the deportation was rejected, and rumor has it he lives in Qatar. 

Bin Laden had lived a relatively quiet life in France, turning to[ painting](https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2021/march/1614517200/mahmood-fazal/artist-formerly-known-bin-laden) and planning to open a restaurant. He began training with al-Qaeda as a teenager but left the group in 2000, distancing himself from his father's violent actions, including the 9/11 attacks. Despite Omar's claims of innocence, the French government upheld the decision to deport him. Authorities have also blocked his return to France under an administrative ban, solidifying his permanent exclusion from the country.

### North Korean Military Officers Killed in Ukraine

South Korea's Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun stated that it is "highly likely" that six North Korean military officers were killed in a Ukrainian [missile attack near Donetsk](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/40169), a Russian-occupied region of Ukraine. This comes amid rising concerns about North Korea's deeper involvement in Russia's war effort. Seoul believes North Korea is not only supplying weapons but also possibly sending soldiers to gain combat experience. They could be preparing to send even more North Korean military officers to the scene.

This development highlights the strengthening military alliance between Russia and North Korea, which has been reinforced through mutual defense agreements and cooperation in military operations since the onset of the Ukraine conflict. The situation is evolving, with concerns about North Korean missiles potentially being used by Russian troops. On his last birthday, Kim Jong Un recently referred to Vladimir Putin as his [“closest comrade."](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq64qm2v7m9o)

### Yemeni Houthis Launch Missiles into Central Israel 

The Houthi movement from Yemen has escalated tensions by reportedly [launching a hypersonic missile](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/17/yemens-houthis-file-hypersonic-missile-at-israel-what-to-know) that struck central Israel, specifically in the Lod area near Tel Aviv. This missile ignited a fire, but fortunately, it resulted in no fatalities, although some residents experienced minor injuries while seeking shelter. 

This attack marks a notable development as it's the first instance of a Houthi strike reaching this part of Israel. While the Houthis have described the missile as hypersonic, Israeli military sources have disputed this claim, asserting that they did not detect such a missile. In response to this incident, Israel has vowed to retaliate against Yemen, which only adds to the [increasing involvement](https://www.dw.com/en/will-yemens-iran-backed-houthis-play-bigger-role-in-the-middle-east-conflict/a-70428565) of various factions in the region.

### French Government: No-Confidence Vote

France's minority government, led by Prime Minister Michel Barnier, narrowly avoided a [no-confidence vote](https://apnews.com/article/france-minority-government-no-confidence-vote-7fa8b612dc28ab33cfeec526a21cce0c) only two weeks after assuming office. The motion, initiated by the left-wing [New Popular Front](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd910je22no) coalition, received only 197 votes, falling short of the 289 needed for passage. The [far-right National Rally](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/25/france-far-right-national-rally-history-1972-marine-le-pen) abstained from voting, allowing Barnier to avoid the vote’s collapse.

Barnier aims to cut the budget deficit from 6% to 5% of GDP by next year through austerity measures and increased taxes on the wealthiest citizens. As the government prepares its 2025 budget, it expects strong opposition from labor unions and left-wing parties. The full implications of these proposed measures remain to be seen.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Which countries hold a claim to Antarctica?**

![Seven nations claim Antarctic territory](/images/who-is-claiming-the-territory-of-antarctica--Y4OD.webp)

Seven countries currently hold [territorial claims](https://www.state.gov/key-topics-office-of-ocean-and-polar-affairs/antarctic/#:~:text=Seven%20countries%20\(Argentina%2C%20Australia%2C,has%20not%20made%20a%20claim.) to parts of Antarctica: Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom. These claims are based on early exploration and proximity to the continent. However, these claims have been "frozen" under the [Antarctic Treaty System](https://www.ats.aq/e/antarctictreaty.html), which governs international cooperation in Antarctica.

The competition for Antarctic territory began to raise concerns in the mid-20th century, particularly in the context of the Cold War. As more countries became interested in Antarctica’s strategic and scientific value, it became apparent that unregulated claims could lead to international conflict. The Antarctic Treaty was signed in 1959 with initially 12 signatories. Since then, the number of signatory countries has grown to over 50. Apart from freezing territorial claims, the Treaty prohibits military activity, encourages scientific cooperation, and enforces strict environmental protections, including a 50-year ban on resource extraction under the 1991 [Madrid Protocol](https://www.ats.aq/e/protocol.html).

Interestingly, The United States and Russia do not have formal claims over the Antarctic territory. Along with many others, both countries are heavily involved in scientific research on the continent through their numerous research stations. In fact, over 50 nations, including Germany, Japan, India, and China, conduct scientific experiments in Antarctica.
