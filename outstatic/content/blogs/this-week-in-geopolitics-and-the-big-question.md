### THIS WEEK IN GEOPOLITICS

**üá∂üá¶ Qatar pulls back:** Qatar recently [suspended](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/09/politics/qatar-gaza-ceasefire-pause-mediator/index.html) its mediation efforts for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, halting negotiations after a lack of progress, particularly in releasing hostages. In a significant move, Qatar closed Hamas‚Äô political office in Doha, a decision aligning with U.S. interests that had [urged](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/21/politics/blinken-qatar-hamas-gaza-negotiations/index.html) Qatar to use its influence over Hamas. However, Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari labeled some media reports ‚Äúinaccurate,‚Äù clarifying that the office closure does not bar its future reopening if negotiations with Israel genuinely resume. Qatar‚Äôs decision reflects its influential [role](https://time.com/7022826/qatar-diplomacy-history/) in regional diplomacy and follows a similar April closure when Hamas officials were moved to Turkey.

**üá™üá∫ Europe Trump-proofs:** Poland, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, is [partnering](https://kyivindependent.com/polish-pm-to-hold-talks-with-leaders-of-uk-france-nato-on-protecting-ukraine-after-trump-victory/) with the United Kingdom to support Ukraine amid potential changes in U.S. policy if Donald Trump returns to office in 2025. Trump has [indicated](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxrwr078v7o) he might pursue a quick resolution to the conflict, possibly requiring Ukrainian concessions to Russia while not fully endorsing Ukraine's victory. Concerned about diminished U.S. support affecting Poland's security, Tusk is seeking President Biden's approval for Ukraine to conduct deeper strikes into Russian territory with Western weapons. Meanwhile, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell recently visited Kyiv, highlighting Europe‚Äôs commitment to providing [$125 billion](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-donald-tusk-meet-eu-uk-leaders-nato-ukraine-after-donald-trump-win/) in aid to Ukraine, surpassing the U.S. contribution of $90 billion.

**üáØüáµ Japanese PM reelected:** Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has been [reelected](https://apnews.com/article/japan-politics-ishiba-cabinet-5945feb06a07730a98ebb3e0b46905bd) by parliament despite his coalition suffering a significant loss in the recent election, marking its worst defeat in over a decade. The [coalition](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/historic-election-defeat-for-japan-s-ruling-party-what-next/3379725) lost its Lower House majority due to scandals and criticism of its handling of economic issues. Ishiba, who narrowly defeated opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda, opted to keep most of his Cabinet but made strategic adjustments to address public dissatisfaction. Seeking stability, Ishiba is open to collaborating on policy with Yuichiro Tamaki‚Äôs Democratic Party for the People, which has grown in popularity for its economic reform stance.

**üá≥üá± Dutch polarization:** In Amsterdam, violence erupted at ‚Äô40-‚Äô45 Square as a group armed with sticks and firecrackers [set fire](https://www.dw.com/en/dutch-tram-set-on-fire-in-new-amsterdam-unrest/a-70759392) to an empty tram, with no injuries reported. This follows tensions during a recent match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax Amsterdam, where [clashes](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgv4mdr9y8o) occurred between Israeli fans and locals. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof condemned the tram attack as an ‚Äúantisemitic act,‚Äù although both fan groups contributed to the unrest. Political polarization in the Netherlands has increased, with right-wing parties blaming migration for social issues while some pro-Palestine advocates resort to extreme protests. Others, however, are calling for a balanced approach to Dutch foreign policy, reflecting the complexities of the political climate.

**üáÆüá∂ Iraqi prisoners get compensation for abuse;** U.S. jury has awarded [$42 million](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/jury-awards-42mn-abu-ghraib-survivors-us-contractor-held-liable-torture) to three Iraqi men‚ÄîSuhail al-Shimari, Salah al-Ejaili, and Asa‚Äôad Zuba‚Äôe‚Äîwho endured torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib prison, marking the first time a private contractor has been held responsible for such actions. The verdict against CACI International, a contractor providing interrogation services during the [U.S. occupation of Iraq](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-64980565), represents a significant milestone in wartime accountability. The plaintiffs faced severe abuse, including beatings, sexual humiliation, and other inhumane treatment, leading them to file a 2008 lawsuit under the [Alien Tort Statute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/alien_tort_statute).

### THE BIG QUESTION

**Why does the Middle East not do more for Palestine?**

At an [Arab-Islamic summit](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/11/israeli-wars-in-gaza-lebanon-on-arab-islamic-summit-agenda-in-saudi-arabia) in Riyadh, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) called for an immediate ceasefire to end Israel‚Äôs military operations in Gaza and Lebanon, condemning the violence as a ‚Äúmassacre.‚Äù A thing that has come into conversation is why many Arab countries lack considerable action in helping the Palestinians. Palestinian refugees in [Lebanon](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/16/palestinians-in-lebanon-its-like-living-in-a-prison) and Jordan have little rights. While Egypt has shown some initiative, it has been [reluctant](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2023/11/jordans-redline-on-admitting-palestinians-is-unlikely-to-change?lang=en) to make it easier for Gazans to enter Egypt freely. The Palestinian Authority passport doesn‚Äôt give the holders of this [visa-free](https://www.passportindex.org/passport/palestinian-territories/) access to countries in the Middle East and North Africa.

Many believe it is up to those responsible for the problem with Israel and Palestine to find a solution, not them. Some of the countries have their own internal and economic issues to reckon with. Several countries, like UAE and Morocco, already had [normalized relations](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/14/23914904/arab-world-israel-palestine-conflict-middle-east) with Israel, and Saudi Arabia was in the process before October 7th, 2023. Although many of the governments have been at a standstill, many of the citizens held views different from the official stances of the government. There is also one more issue that remains as well: if the situation with Israel-Palestine does get resolved, many of the countries in the Middle East have one less party to blame for friction in the Middle East.
