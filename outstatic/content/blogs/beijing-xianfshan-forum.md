### Beijing’s Xiangshan Forum Kicks Off

China’s Xiangshan forum started on Friday and will continue through the weekend. The conference had 500 representatives from 90 countries, not all of whom had to be major Chinese allies. The US and plenty of [NATO](https://www.dw.com/en/china-kicks-off-top-security-forum-amid-global-tensions/a-70198229) countries also attend. This year’s theme is “Promoting peace through a shared future.” Some issues that will be covered are security in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, international rules, and the future of AI intelligence.

This conference was started in 2006 as a counterconference to the Shangri-La Forum in Singapore. Chinese delegates who attend the Shangri-La forum find it too saturated with US and Western narratives. The Chinese delegation is usually criticized for its part in the South China Sea conflicts, which are a complex issue in Southeast Asia, but also for Taiwan and its role in the Ukrainian-Russian conflict.

China uses this conference to gain its “home court advantage” in geopolitical issues. Another goal of this conference is to engage countries in the Global South, which can often be undermined. However, some analysts have said China uses these countries more to gain clout against the West than to pay attention to their views and concerns. The Chinese narrative is more about pushing multilateralism.

### Russia Expels 6 British Diplomats

Russia's security service said on Friday that they are expelling six British diplomats in Moscow after accusing them of spying and sabotage work. The British have retaliated by saying they are baseless claims and a [“tit for tat”](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-revokes-accreditation-six-uk-diplomats-interfax-reports-2024-09-13/) action retaliation on some measures the UK took against some Russian diplomats earlier this year.

The announcement came right before UK and US officials were to meet and discuss some measures regarding Ukraine’s defense against Russia, one of the major ones involving letting Ukraine use long-term missiles in Russia. Putin said this is an escalation on NATO’s part and putting the West more directly in the war.

### US Secretary of State Promises Ukraine More Aid

​​US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has pledged 700 million USD of Humanitarian Aid for Ukraine. He announced this in Kyiv. This comes right at a time when Ukraine needs to boost its [energy grid](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-blinken-and-top-uk-diplomat-jointly-pledge-almost-1-5-billion-in-more-ukraine-aid) before the winter. The UK Foreign Secretary has pledged $782 in aid for Ukraine, bringing the total aid from the two countries to $1.5 billion.

While UK and US assistance to Ukraine has increased this week, the more burning question is whether US and UK officials will allow Ukraine to use long missiles in Russian territory. Blinken said he has raised this issue to the Biden Administration, and it will be on top of the agenda when President Biden meets with the UK prime minister in Washington.

### The US Sanctions Venezuelan officials

The United States has announced it is placing sanctions on sixteen officials who are closely aligned with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. [Five judges](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw3wn6geewo) who agreed to award him his third term are among the main targets. Some members of the security forces are also sanctioned for their role in the government crackdowns on dissent. The judge who issued the arrest warrant for the opposition, Edmundo González, is also part of the list.

The US is one of the countries that refused to acknowledge the results of the Venezuelan elections since July. The counter-narrative is that the US government has been using Gonzales as a puppet to disturb the political landscape of Venezuela.

### Jamaican Soldiers Arrive in Haiti

Half a dozen soldiers and police from Jamacia arrived in Haiti to join a UN mission led by Kenya to relieve the country's [gang problem](https://apnews.com/article/jamaican-soldiers-police-arrive-haiti-gangs-deployed-230accf4bc1531f5f9a07d6aa2a9876c). Belize is also sending some personnel to assist with this. Haiti is considered a failed state. Haiti’s capital, Port Au Prince, is 80% controlled by gangs.

The mission is expected to have 2500 personnel from the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Benin, and Chad. The US warns that this mission needs more resources and is considering launching a peacekeeping mission with Ecuador to raise more money. The UN Security Council would have to vote on it, but it is unlikely as the last one was unsuccessful and caused more problems.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is ASEAN?**

![ASEAN](/images/asean-gyMj.jpg)

ASEAN is the abbreviation for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It is a regional organization that brings together ten Southeast Asian countries: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. ASEAN was formed in 1967 to promote peace, stability, and economic cooperation in the region. In some ways, it’s a bit like the European Union.

One key thing that makes ASEAN similar to the European Union is its diversity. The member countries vary incredibly in culture, religion, and languages. Economically, ASEAN has done a great job of strengthening regional trade. Their free trade area makes it easier for goods to move between the countries without high tariffs. The Bloc also has trade agreements with big players like China, Japan, and the EU.

Politically, ASEAN has a principle of "non-interference.”While this promotes harmony, it can sometimes present problems, especially regarding human rights issues like in Myanmar. ASEAN doesn’t have freedom of movement like the European Union, but all the countries can visit each other without a visa.

ASEAN plays a major role in the region by providing a platform for collaboration and development. Although it has room for improvement, ASEAN has fostered peace and growth for more than 55 years for a group of countries that are so different.
