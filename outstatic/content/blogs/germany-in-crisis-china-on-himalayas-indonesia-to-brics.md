### German political crisis

Germany‚Äôs first three-way coalition government, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, has [collapsed](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/07/europe/germany-government-collapse-explainer-intl/index.html) following deep divisions among the ruling parties. The [Social Democrats](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Social-Democratic-Party-of-Germany) (SPD), [Free Democrats](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Free-Democratic-Party-political-party-Germany) (FDP), and [Greens](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Green-Party-of-Germany) met for a final attempt at compromise but parted ways after two hours, leading Scholz to [dismiss Finance Minister](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/06/europe/germany-government-scholz-finance-minister-intl-latam/index.html) Christian Lindner. Lindner accused Scholz of attempting to bypass Germany‚Äôs constitutional debt limits, while the SPD and the Greens, led by Economy Minister Robert Habeck and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, criticized the FDP for being too rigid in not allowing additional funds during what they considered a fiscal emergency.

The coalition‚Äôs failure stems partly from a [court ruling](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/15/german-court-rules-budget-maneuver-unconstitutional.html) in November 2023 that nullified ‚Ç¨60 billion earmarked for climate action, exposing the coalition‚Äôs financial and ideological rifts. After ongoing conflicts, Chancellor Scholz is pushing for a vote of confidence in January 2024, potentially leading to early elections by March.

### China-Bhutan

China is building new villages in [disputed Himalayan areas](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/05/asia/china-bhutan-border-dst-intl-hnk/index.html) near Bhutan, creating concerns for Bhutan and India. The villages, including [Demalong](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Demalong/@28.0010089,90.9021841,11.66z?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTEwNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), lie in territories claimed by Bhutan but marked as Chinese on China‚Äôs maps. For years, Bhutan has engaged in cautious negotiations with China while relying on close ties with India, its key ally. Tensions rose sharply in 2017 when Indian troops countered Chinese construction in Bhutan‚Äôs [Doklam region](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Doklam,+Shigatse/@27.4156988,88.8781907,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x39e1428fd73d443d:0xf7c1ac11124d1f1d!8m2!3d27.4054718!4d89.0561532!16s%2Fg%2F11fxb85ztm?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTEwNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), close to India‚Äôs strategically crucial Siliguri Corridor.

China‚Äôs settlement-building strategy, resembling its strategies in the [South China Sea](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13748349), aims to solidify territorial claims by encouraging Chinese citizens to move to contested areas. This expansion reflects China‚Äôs intention to counter India‚Äôs regional influence and assert its presence in Bhutanese-claimed land despite ongoing border negotiations with Bhutan.

### Indonesia for BRICS¬†

Indonesia‚Äôs bid for [BRICS membership](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3284927/how-indonesia-going-its-own-way-beijing-brics-and-south-china-sea) aims to strengthen its global influence and assert its leadership among emerging economies. At the [BRICS Plus Summit](https://brics-russia2024.ru/en/summit/), Foreign Minister Sugiono highlighted Indonesia‚Äôs commitment to ‚ÄúGlobal South‚Äù interests, focusing on food and energy security, poverty alleviation, and human capital development. This marks President Prabowo‚Äôs first foreign policy move, aligning with his ‚Äúgood neighbor policy‚Äù of cooperation and anti-oppression.

However, the move presents challenges, as China‚Äôs significant influence within BRICS could limit Indonesia‚Äôs autonomy. Additionally, economic instability among BRICS members may hinder potential benefits. Indonesia‚Äôs interest, however, signals a nuanced approach: engaging with diverse powers while maintaining its independence. By balancing Western partnerships with BRICS aspirations, Indonesia is a middle power that fosters a more inclusive global order.

**üá∞üá¨ Kyrgyzstan**: The Organization of Turkic States‚Äô Council of Foreign Ministers [(OTS)](https://www.mfa.gov.tr/turk-konseyi-en.en.mfa) convened in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, on November 6 to discuss strategies for enhancing [unity among Turkic nations](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/meeting-of-turkic-states-foreign-ministers-begins-in-kyrgyzstan/3385581). Chaired by Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Jeenbek Kulubayev, the agenda focused on economic integration, sustainable development, digital advancement, and security. Ministers from T√ºrkiye, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and observer-state Hungary, represented by Peter Szijjarto, were in attendance. Key initiatives included a roadmap for transitioning to a green economy and a final summit declaration. The Ala Archa Congress Center meeting underscores the organization‚Äôs commitment to regional cooperation and a cohesive future for the Turkic world.

**üá™üá∫ EU:** German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron [held a telephone call](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-france-vow-close-cooperation-after-us-election/a-70710169) on Wednesday to discuss the potential impact of a second term for [Donald Trump](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/how-donald-trump-won/index.html) in the White House. Both leaders agreed to work more closely to ensure a stronger, more sovereign Europe while continuing cooperation with the US to defend shared values and interests. Meanwhile, defense ministers from Germany and France are set to meet to discuss the implications of Trump‚Äôs possible return, particularly regarding his stance on Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine. Trump‚Äôs previous presidency saw strained relations with NATO allies, and it remains uncertain how his foreign policy would evolve, especially concerning Ukraine.
