### US and South Korea hold military exercises

The United States and South Korea started their annual joint military exercises to practice and prepare against potential threats from North Korea. The drills will last until August 29th. These drills involve tens of thousands of troops and advanced weaponry, including simulated defensive operations, cyber warfare, and missile interception. North Korea is complaining about the exercises as provocative. They accused the two countries of staging a rehearsal for a future invasion. The U.S. and South Korea express the importance of these exercises to maintain regional security and discourage potential escalations with North Korea. South Korea is one of the most important allies in Asia for the US.

### Ukraine bans churches with ties to Moscow

The Ukrainian parliament on Aug. 20 passed a bill banning activities of religious organizations connected to Russia. The most likely church affected is the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, connected to the Russian Orthodox Church. Many of its members, mainly its clergy, are loyal to Russia and support their cause in the war. . Russian passports, propaganda, and xenophobic material have been uncovered multiple times by Ukrainian authorities. Leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church have said this is unlawful and violates Religious freedom laws in Ukraine. This move could help Russia frame narratives of religious persecution in Ukraine. Orthodox Christianity is allowed in Ukraine but must be independent of Russian ties.

### Allegations of Iranian hacking

The US has accused Iran of hacking and interfering with its elections. The US intelligence community is relatively confident that Iranian operatives are using social engineering and other means of access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns of both parties. They say their main goal is to add to the political division going on in American politics. Iran has denied these allegations and demanded evidence. Earlier this year, there were allegations that Iran was actively taking advantage of US influencers who are part of the free Palestine movement for their interest. The intelligence agencies have not released any evidence of interference.
