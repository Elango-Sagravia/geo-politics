### Kashmir Holds First Regional Elections Since 2019

On Wednesday, India’s Kashmir and Jammu region held its first [regional elections](https://www.dw.com/en/india-kashmir-votes-in-assembly-elections-after-a-decade/a-70245012) in over a decade, with the final results expected by October 8th. These elections are significant as they mark the first since Kashmir lost its regional autonomy in 2019 when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi revoked its special status and brought the region under federal control.

Kashmir is a contested region, with India governing 55%, Pakistan controlling 30%, and China claiming 15% in the Aksai Chin area. Tensions between these countries have simmered for decades, with multiple conflicts over the territory. [Historically](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11693674), Kashmir is a Himalayan region that both India and Pakistan claim in full. It was once a princely state called Jammu and Kashmir, which chose to join India in 1947 after the sub-continent was divided at the end of British rule. India and Pakistan subsequently went to war over the region, with each side controlling different parts of the territory after a ceasefire line was agreed.

Voter turnout for Wednesday’s election was relatively high at 59%. The key focus of this election is how pro-independence parties will perform, as their success could lead to renewed discussions on autonomy and potential changes in the region's governance.

### Georgia Passes Anti-LGBT Legislation

The Georgian parliament has passed new [anti-LGBT laws](https://www.rferl.org/a/georgia-lgbt-law-rights-parliament/33123479.html) that impose restrictions on LGBT rights, including the ability to ban cultural events like pride marches. The legislation was passed with an 84-0 vote, as opposition parties have been boycotting parliament since May. The move has sparked concerns about the shrinking space for LGBT rights in Georgia.

Georgia plays a significant role in the geopolitical struggle between Russia and the West. Although the country has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine, recent legislation has mirrored Russia’s anti-LGBT laws, raising eyebrows internationally. Earlier this year, Georgia faced significant [protests](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-69001339) over a foreign influence bill that resembled Russian policies. The country is set to hold presidential elections in October, where these issues are likely to feature prominently.

### EU Considers Deducting €200 Million from Hungary’s EU Funds

Hungary faces a potential €200 million deduction from its EU funds after missing a [second deadline](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/18/brussels-moves-to-deduct-200-million-fine-from-hungarys-eu-funds-as-country-refuses-to-pay) to pay a fine issued by the European Court of Justice. The fine was imposed due to Hungary’s restrictive asylum policies, which the EU has deemed unlawful. As a result, the EU is considering deducting the amount directly from Hungary’s allocated funds.

Hungary has been one of the most vocal critics of the EU’s asylum and migration policies. In response to the EU’s actions, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has suggested sending buses of migrants from Budapest to Brussels, signaling growing [tensions](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/09/belgium-strongly-rejects-hungarys-provocation-to-bus-migrants-to-brussels) between Hungary and the EU. Orbán has also demanded €2 billion from the EU for border protection, claiming that Hungary has borne the brunt of the migrant crisis since 2015.

### Lebanon Faces More Explosions

On Wednesday, a [series of explosions](https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-pagers-explode-hezbollah-israel-09-18-24-intl-hnk/index.html) rocked Lebanon, killing 20 people and injuring hundreds. These attacks come shortly after Hezbollah authorities and Lebanese officials warned of retaliation against Israel for an explosion earlier this week [(see previous write-up)](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/meta-bans-russian-state-media). Israel’s defense minister has warned of a new era of warfare, escalating fears of a broader regional conflict.

The rising violence between Lebanon, Hezbollah, and Israel has the potential to pull other regional powers into the fray, particularly Iran, which supports Hezbollah. With tensions already high due to the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict, this could further destabilize the Middle East. Other regional actors may be forced to step up their efforts to mediate or contain the situation before it spirals out of control.

### Ukraine Attacks Russian Ammunition Depot

Ukraine’s secret service revealed that Ukraine drones struck a Russian ammunition depot in Western Russia. The strike caused a [massive explosion](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-updates-ammo-depot-in-russias-tver-region-explodes/live-70246486) that earthquake monitoring stations picked up. Ukraine’s strategy of targeting ammunition depots aims to reduce Russia’s ability to launch missile strikes, which have devastated Ukrainian cities, including Kharkiv.

The situation in Russia and Ukraine continues to be heated. Each day, both sides manage to gain a small amount while simultaneously having a piece of their territory compromised. The more significant issue that hangs over both Russia and Ukraine is whether Western powers will authorize Ukraine's use of long missiles. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that any deployment of long-range missiles could draw the West further into the conflict, raising the stakes for all involved.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Passport power: Which country has the strongest passport?**

![What is the most powerful passport in the world?](/images/what-is-the-most-powerful-passport--Q0MT.webp)

According to the [Henley Passport Index](https://www.henleyglobal.com/passport-index/ranking), Singapore's passport is currently the most powerful. Singaporeans have access to 195 countries. The second most powerful passport is a five-way tie shared between Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and Spain. There are more ties for second place because China has recently allowed a handful of European countries to visit visa-free for 15 days until the end of 2025.

The Henley Passport Index ranks global passports by the number of destinations their holders can access without a visa or with visa-on-arrival or electronic visa waivers that only need a day to process, such as ESTA. The index is updated regularly and based on data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The index highlights travel freedom and reflects the shifts in international mobility and visa policies.

While the Henley passport index is the most effective measurement, some nuances with passport freedom can be examined that are not only measured by a measure of visa-free destinations. For instance, Serbia, ranked 35th, allows visa-free travel to China, the EU, and Russia—benefits that many higher-ranked passports lack.
