[The shooter](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-09-08-2024-5278cf1f7ec254fb6ecca0f2758e7e3a), a 39-year-old Jordanian national, approached the Allenby Bridge Crossing in a truck and opened fire at Israeli security forces.

In response to the incident, both Jordan and Israel have temporarily closed their borders. While relations between the two nations have been peaceful since the 1990s, Jordanian public opinion tends to support Palestinians. Although Jordan has previously played a diplomatic role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, its involvement has been limited since October 7.

### Venezuelan Opposition Candidate Seeks Asylum in Spain

Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez has fled to Spain, where he intends to [seek asylum](https://www.dw.com/en/venezuelan-anti-maduro-candidate-says-he-wont-give-up/a-70166074), according to Spanish officials. Following a contentious political climate after the July elections, Gonzalez went into hiding after facing arrest warrants on charges such as sedition.

Spain has become a common refuge for Venezuelan dissidents due to the shared language and the ability of many to claim Spanish citizenship through ancestry. While the U.S., EU, and several Latin American countries recognize Gonzalez as the rightful leader of Venezuela, nations such as Iran, Russia, and China accept the official election results, contributing to a broader international divide.

### Algerian President Secures Second Term

Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has been re-elected with 94.7% of the vote. His [victory](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/8/algerias-abdelmadjid-tebboune-re-elected-president-with-94-7-percent-vote) was widely anticipated, but voter turnout was low, with reports suggesting only 6 million out of 24 million eligible voters participated.

Tebboune rose to power after pro-democracy protests ousted his predecessor, but his popularity has since waned, particularly among the younger generation, who see him as maintaining the status quo. Despite increasing social spending, critics accuse him of restricting civil liberties and human rights. Algeria, Africa’s second most populous country, is one of several nations on the continent to hold elections this year.

### French Protests Erupt Over New Prime Minister Appointment

Protests have broken out across France in response to President Emmanuel Macron’s [selection](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240907-french-protesters-rage-at-stolen-election-as-macron-picks-conservative-barnier-for-pm) for prime minister. Macron chose a candidate from the conservative center, bypassing the top three parties that emerged from the July run-off elections. Critics claim the decision was an attempt to appease the far-right, which also opposes Macron but is willing to negotiate.

The left bloc, which had unified multiple parties to take the top spot in the July elections, had put forward Lucie Casets as its preferred choice for prime minister. Despite internal differences, the left bloc has rallied around Casets, intensifying public opposition to Macron’s pick.

### Poland Seeks Arrests of Belarusian Officials Over 2021 Ryanair Incident

Polish prosecutors are moving to charge three Belarusian officials over the [forced landing](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-belarusia-suspects-ryanair-flight-diversion-arrest-warrants-aleksandr-lukashenko/) of a Ryanair plane in Minsk in 2021. The plane, which was registered in Poland, was diverted under a false bomb threat. Upon landing, Belarusian dissident Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend were arrested. The officials under investigation include leaders from Belarus’s Air Navigation Agency, Air Traffic Control, and Secret Service.

Polish authorities aim to secure European arrest warrants for the suspects, but bringing them to justice could prove difficult if they remain in Belarus. This incident has further strained relations between Belarus and neighboring Lithuania and Poland, both of which have longstanding tensions with the Belarusian government.
