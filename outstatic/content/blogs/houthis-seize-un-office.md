### Houthis Seize UN Rights Office in Sanaa Amid Intensified Crackdown

Yemen's Houthi rebels have stormed the United Nations Human Rights Office in Sanaa, seizing documents, vehicles, and furniture, escalating their crackdown on U.N. and NGO workers. The U.N. suspended operations in Houthi-controlled areas after this August 3rd raid. The incident is part of a broader campaign, including the detention of over 60 humanitarian workers since June. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have also targeted Red Sea shipping amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, further complicating the already dire humanitarian crisis in Yemen. The U.N. has demanded the immediate return of its assets.

The Philippines has lodged a diplomatic protest against China after Chinese jets flew dangerously close to a Philippine Air Force patrol plane and fired flares near Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea.

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. called the actions "unjustified, illegal, and reckless." Despite Chinese warnings, the Philippines vowed to intensify its airspace monitoring, underscoring the ongoing tension in the region.

Ukrainian forces continue their unprecedented incursion into Russia's Kursk region but are encountering intensified Russian resistance. Despite initial gains, Ukrainian troops have struggled to advance further, facing counterattacks and reinforcements from Russian forces.

### Ex-Commander of Lord's Resistance Army Convicted in Uganda

In a significant moment for justice in Uganda, former Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) commander Thomas Kwoyelo has been convicted of 44 counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, and enslavement. The High Court’s verdict in Gulu marks the first atrocity case tried under Uganda’s special division for international crimes. Kwoyelo, who led violent attacks during the LRA's brutal insurgency from 1992 to 2005, has been in detention since 2009. His conviction brings some closure to victims of the LRA, a rebel group notorious for its brutality, including the abduction of children as soldiers and sex slaves.

Ethiopian and Somali officials acknowledged the progress and reiterated their commitment to resolving the conflict peacefully.

### **Tragedy in Gaza: Israeli Airstrikes Leave Children Orphaned**

In the latest escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict, Israeli airstrikes have devastated families in Gaza, leaving young children as the sole survivors. A three-month-old baby girl, Reem Abu Hayyah, was the only one left alive after her parents and five siblings were killed in Khan Younis. In another strike, Mohamed Abuel-Qomasan lost his wife and newborn twins. The relentless bombardment has orphaned thousands of children, many too young to remember their lost loved ones. Despite Israel’s claims of targeting militants, the human toll continues to mount in Gaza's densely populated areas.
