### Brics Summit Starts Today

The upcoming BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, will bring together [world leaders](https://www.euronews.com/2024/10/21/putin-to-host-brics-summit-in-a-bid-to-advance-russias-own-interests) like Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Masoud Pezeshkian. Despite Western isolation attempts due to the Ukraine war, the summit highlights Russia‚Äôs defiance and [BRICS](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-66525474)‚Äô growing influence as the bloc expands to include countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia.¬†

Putin sees this as a crucial moment to bolster Russia‚Äôs global alliances and negotiate economic deals. China and India are key players in expanding trade and military ties, while Russia aims to bypass Western sanctions. Brazilian President Luiz Lula da Silva has [canceled his trip](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89l45zeq2eo) to Russia for the BRICS summit due to a head injury sustained at home, requiring him to avoid long-haul flights temporarily. He will now participate in the summit via video link.

### Moldova‚Äôs Close EU Vote

Moldova narrowly voted to join the European Union, with [50.4% supporting](https://www.dw.com/en/moldova-narrowly-votes-yes-to-eu-membership/a-70544401) the constitutional change to enshrine EU membership and 49.6% opposing it. The results almost appeared to be a ‚Äúno‚Äù¬† until late Monday morning when the Moldovans abroad came in. This election happened amid accusations of [Russian interference](https://www.dw.com/en/moldovas-eu-referendum-beset-by-alleged-russian-meddling/a-70527782) through vote-buying and propaganda. Pro-Western President Maia Sandu blamed foreign forces for the tight race.¬†

This victory for the pro-EU side is seen as a defeat for Russia. Moldova is now focused on completing EU accession talks, aiming for membership by 2030, but this isn‚Äôt a guarantee as EU accession can take over a decade. Moldova has many issues to settle and obstacles [(see our write-up)](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/poverty-affects-billion-hamas-leader-killed-moldova-to-eu).¬†

### Israel-Iran Attack Plans Leaked

![The US is probing a leak of classified Israeli strike plans on Iran](/images/us-investigating-leak-of-classified-documents-about-israels-plans-to-attack-iran-cyNj.webp)

The US is currently investigating a leak of highly [classified intelligence](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html) regarding Israel‚Äôs preparations for a potential strike on Iran. These documents, marked ‚Äútop secret‚Äù and shared among [‚ÄúFive Eyes‚Äù](https://privacyinternational.org/learn/five-eyes) allies, were first posted on Telegram by the [‚ÄúMiddle East Spectator‚Äù](https://t.me/s/Middle_East_Spectator) account. They detail Israeli military movements and exercises, hinting at plans for retaliation after Iran‚Äôs [missile barrage](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/01/politics/iran-missile-attack-israel/index.html) on October 1.¬†

This leak raises alarm about US-Israeli trust and coordination, especially at such a sensitive time in their relations. US authorities are working to determine how the leak occurred. This could make the US re-evaluate how much assistance it might be willing to give Israel in the future. Meanwhile, Iran is bracing for Israeli retaliation by courting as many allies as it can. Iran could start to look towards Russia [for a favor](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/21/iran-aided-russia-against-ukraine-now-it-needs-to-call-in-the-favor.html) in return for the missiles they provided them to strike Ukraine.

**üá∞üáµ**Ukrainian President Zelensky has accused **North Korea** of deploying troops to aid **Russia** in the war, marking a troubling new alliance. Although specifics are scarce, this collaboration raises concerns about the shifting dynamics in the **Ukraine** conflict, as North Korea's military support could further complicate international responses.

üáÆüá©Former general Prabowo Subianto was [sworn in](https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-new-president-prabowo-subianto-sworn-44f1cb606ab8aa825b20b7f154ba9721) as **Indonesia**‚Äôs president, marking a new chapter for the nation. With a focus on strengthening the military and addressing domestic economic issues, Prabowo‚Äôs leadership is already drawing attention due to his past [human rights controversies](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68028295). His presidency may shape Indonesia's role in regional and global affairs, especially amid rising tensions in Southeast Asia.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is BRICS?**¬†

![BRICS, representing Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa](/images/what-is-brics-A1Mj.webp)

[BRICS](https://infobrics.org/page/history-of-brics/) is an acronym for five major emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Established in 2009, the bloc is set to officially [welcome five new members](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-66525474) at its summit this week: Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Other aspiring members include Indonesia and Argentina; however, Argentina's interest has waned since its new president took office in December 2023.

The primary goal of BRICS is to promote cooperation and dialogue among its members on economic, political, and social issues. The bloc focuses on reforming international financial institutions, enhancing trade and investment, and fostering sustainable development.

BRICS holds annual summits to discuss collaborative initiatives and address global challenges. As a counterbalance to Western-dominated groups like the [G7](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-does-g7-do), BRICS represents a significant portion of the world‚Äôs population and economic output, emphasizing the growing influence of emerging markets in global affairs.

However, BRICS is not without criticism. Some argue that the bloc needs more precise goals beyond balancing U.S. and Western hegemony. Many members have competing interests, and not all countries within the bloc maintain warm relationships with one another.
