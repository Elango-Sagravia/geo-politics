### Kamala Harris Supports Armenia

In her address marking Armenian Independence Day, Kamala Harris [called](https://oc-media.org/kamala-harris-expresses-support-for-nagorno-karabakh-armenians-right-to-return/) for the right of displaced Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh to return to their homes. She highlighted the importance of this step for restoring dignity and stability in the region and reaffirmed her commitment to supporting Armenia's democratic and peace-building efforts. While Harris has not outlined a comprehensive plan for Armenia, it is expected to be part of her future agenda.

Reactions to Harris's statement were mixed. Some Armenians appreciated her clear stance, especially in contrast to Russia's position. However, others, including the Armenian National Committee of America, criticized her for delayed action and expressed concern over the U.S. supplying arms to Azerbaijan. Armenia and Azerbaijan have been [in conflict](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/nagorno-karabakh-conflict) for several years, with tensions dating back to the Soviet era. Yet, with the global focus on Ukraine and Gaza, many Armenians feel their plight has been overlooked on the international stage.

The U.S. maintains a strategic relationship with Azerbaijan, which is primarily driven by energy cooperation and oil and gas imports. This partnership also serves as a counterbalance to Russia, though historically, Russia has maintained positive ties with Azerbaijan and Armenia. At the same time, the U.S. has a strong Armenian-American community that actively lobbies for Armenian causes, and it has been critical of Azerbaijan’s human rights record. Despite this, the Biden administration has not imposed sanctions on Azerbaijan but is currently assessing whether the country has committed ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh.

### Macron Calls for Limiting UN Security Council Veto Power

French President Emmanuel Macron has called for reforming the UN Security Council by limiting the veto power of permanent members. Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Macron argued that vetoes should not be used in situations of mass atrocities, taking a direct jab at Russia, which has frequently blocked resolutions regarding Ukraine. This is a significant move, given that France itself holds veto power as one of the [five permanent members (P5)](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/content/current-members#:~:text=PERMANENT%20AND%20NON%2DPERMANENT%20MEMBERS&text=Five%20permanent%20members%3A%20China%2C%20France,Ecuador%20\(2024\)).

This proposal comes at a time when global leaders are pushing for a more representative and effective UN. In his speech, Macron addressed a range of [pressing global issues](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240925-ukraine-lebanon-gaza-and-limiting-un-veto-power-takeaways-from-macron-s-speech-at-the-un). He condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, highlighted the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and urged international efforts to stabilize Lebanon. 

### Putin Revises Russia's Nuclear Doctrine

![Russian President Vladimir Putin announced changes to the country’s nuclear doctrine](/images/russias-president-vladimir-putin-has-announced-a-revision-to-moscows-nuclear-doctrine-M2Nz.webp)

Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced changes to the country’s [nuclear doctrine](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/3/why-is-russia-changing-its-nuclear-doctrine-amid-the-ukraine-war), stating that Russia could consider any nuclear attack on its allies as an attack on itself. This shift signals Russia’s readiness to use its nuclear arsenal not just defensively but also to protect non-nuclear allies.

The doctrine change comes amid rising tensions with NATO, as Russia continues to view Western expansion in Eastern Europe as a direct threat. Putin’s revision is likely intended to send a message to the West that any interference in Russia’s sphere of influence could escalate quickly​.

### Sunni-Shiite Clash in Pakistan Turns Deadly

A violent clash between Sunni and Shiite tribes in Pakistan’s Kurram district has resulted in over 20 deaths. The conflict erupted over longstanding sectarian tensions, which have plagued the region for decades. Such clashes are not uncommon in Pakistan, where sectarian violence often flares up during periods of political or social unrest​.

These [tensions](https://www.cfr.org/article/sunni-shia-divide) reflect the broader regional dynamics between Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia and Shiite-majority Iran, both of which have vested interests in Pakistan. The clash could exacerbate internal instability and hinder Pakistan’s attempts to balance relations with both Tehran and Riyadh.

### Spain to Boycott Mexico’s Presidential Inauguration

Spain has officially announced it will boycott the inauguration of Mexico's new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, after a [diplomatic incident](https://www.exteriores.gob.es/en/Comunicacion/Comunicados/Paginas/2024_COMUNICADOS/20240924_COMU055.aspx) involving Spain’s King Felipe VI. The snub occurred when Sheinbaum failed to formally invite King Felipe VI to her inauguration, a gesture typically extended to heads of state. In response, the Spanish government decided to send no official representatives to the event.

Tensions between Spain and Mexico have been rising in recent years, particularly under outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has been openly critical of Spain’s colonial past. The latest incident could further strain relations, as Mexico's political stance has increasingly shifted towards Latin American alliances, distancing itself from its historical ties with Europe. 

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is Republika Srpska?**

![](/images/what-is-republika-srpska--A3Mz.webp)

Many travelers who visit the Balkans learn that there is a region called [“Republika Srpska”](https://www.dw.com/en/what-is-republika-srpska/a-64373205) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and they think they have returned to Serbia. Serbia is “Republic of Serbia”—it is its own country. “Republika Srpska” is not. 

Republika Srpska is one of the two autonomous entities that make up Bosnia and Herzegovina, the other being the [Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina](https://www.britannica.com/place/Federation-of-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina). Established in 1992 during the Bosnian War, Republika Srpska is primarily inhabited by ethnic Serbs. Its capital is Banja Luka, which covers approximately 49% of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s territory.

This resulted from the [Dayton Peace Agreement](https://www.osce.org/bih/126173) in 1995, which ended the Bosnian War (1992–1995). The war was part of the breakup of the former Yugoslavia and involved intense ethnic conflict, particularly among Bosnian Muslims, Croats, and Serbs. Republika Srpska maintains a strong Serbian cultural and political identity today, often pushing for increased autonomy or secession. This ongoing tension contributes to Bosnia and Herzegovina's political complexity, making it one of Europe's most decentralized and divided nations.
