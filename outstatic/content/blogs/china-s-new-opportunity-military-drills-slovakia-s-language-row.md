### China’s opportunity

As world leaders gather for the [APEC summit](https://apecceosummit2024.com/) in Peru and the [G20 meeting](https://www.g20.org/en/) in Brazil, China is preparing for the uncertainty of a potential second Trump presidency. Chinese leader Xi Jinping views these summits as a critical opportunity to position China as a stable global leader while trying to drive a wedge between the US and its allies. Xi’s message will likely emphasize cooperation and global stability, especially as Trump’s policies threaten to isolate China further. 

A couple of Trump’s [cabinet appointees](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/13/trump-signals-hard-line-on-china-with-hawkish-cabinet-picks) have a hawkish position on China, which could affect the strategic relationship. However, plenty of [European leaders](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-commission-braces-tougher-relationship-china-trade-kaja-kallas/) are also tough on China. Despite China’s efforts to project itself as a reliable partner, tensions remain over its actions in the South China Sea, Taiwan, and Russia. If the US retreats from global institutions, China could expand its influence, but its economic challenges may limit its ability to capitalize on this shift fully. 

### Australia and Indonesia

Indonesian and Australian forces began [joint combat drills](https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-australia-joint-military-exercise-a65a21004a1ec821c5b2f61d2bb8154e) on Wednesday off Java’s coast, with around 2,000 troops participating in air, maritime, and amphibious operations. The Keris Woomera 2024 exercise, involving live-fire drills and disaster response scenarios, aims to strengthen the defense ties between the two countries following the recent Australia-Indonesia Defense Cooperation [Agreement](https://www.minister.defence.gov.au/media-releases/2024-08-29/australia-indonesia-defence-cooperation-agreement-signed#:~:text=Australia%20and%20Indonesia%20to%20operate,protections%20for%20our%20respective%20personnel.). 

While relations have had tensions, such as wiretapping allegations and [capital punishment issues](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-32492182), the exercise seeks to improve military interoperability and regional stability. Australia is an essential relationship for Indonesia. Another peculiar matter is that Indonesia’s new president, Prabowo Subianto, is focused on expanding defense ties, recently conducting exercises with [Russia](https://www.dw.com/en/indonesia-and-russia-hold-first-joint-naval-exercises/a-70684385) and fostering cooperation with China, despite ongoing [South China Sea](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-says-it-has-no-overlapping-south-china-sea-claims-with-china-despite-2024-11-11/) disputes. 

### Slovak language law

![Slovakia's proposed language law amendment prioritizing Slovak over minority languages raises concerns about minority rights and EU relations](/images/slovakia-hungarian-riff-with-minority-rights-and-language-laws-Q4ND.webp)

Slovakia is [proposing](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/13/slovakias-draft-language-law-sparks-fears-over-rights-of-hungarian-minority) an amendment to its language law, which is sparking concerns about the rights of the Hungarian minority and could worsen diplomatic relations between Slovakia and Hungary. The draft legislation mandates that Slovak text appear first on public signs and advertisements, bans minority languages on public transport and in places like post offices, and imposes fines of up to €15,000 for non-compliance.

[Slovak opposition parties](https://www.politico.eu/article/slovakia-risk-beef-hungary-new-language-law/), such as Freedom and Solidarity (SaS) and the Hungarian Alliance, argue the law could harm tourism, reduce Slovakia’s competitiveness, and attract EU criticism.

Hungarians comprise about 8% of Slovakia’s 5.4 million population.  Slovakia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with Hungary ruling the region. This could break some of the bonds between Slovakia and Hungary. Prime ministers Victor Orban and Robert Ficos have been on the same [wavelength](https://balkaninsight.com/2024/01/15/fico-orban-meeting-in-budapest-courtesy-call-or-bromance/) of many ongoing EU issues in the last year.  

**🇳🇪 Niger:** Niger’s military rulers [pulled the license](https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20241113-niger-military-junta-bans-french-humanitarian-ngo-acted) of the French humanitarian NGO “Acted” on Tuesday, adding to tensions with France. [Acted](https://www.acted.org/en/) had been working in the country since 2009, helping displaced people amid ongoing jihadist violence. The government didn’t give a specific reason for the move. It is part of a broader shift since the [July 2023 coup](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/7/26/a-year-after-nigers-coup-split-political-loyalties-test-family-ties), when Niger’s leaders turned away from France and started building ties with other juntas in Mali and Burkina Faso, as well as Russia. The same day, another local NGO, APBE, also had its license revoked, and pro-government figures celebrated the move as a step toward national sovereignty.

**🇺🇲 USA:** President-elect Donald Trump [nominated](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/mike-huckabee-israel/index.html) former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, citing Huckabee’s strong support for Israel and its people. Huckabee is a staunch defender of Israeli sovereignty. He has repeatedly expressed support for Israeli claims to the West Bank and its settlements. His nomination is seen as aligning with Trump’s [policies](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/06/middleeast/trump-middle-east-iran-israel-saudi-gulf-mime-intl/index.html), including the relocation of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing the Golan Heights as Israeli territory. 

### FOUNDATIONS

**What was the Treaty of Trianon?**

![The Treaty of Trianon, signed in 1920, significantly reduced Hungary’s territory, losing regions to Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia](/images/treaty-of-trianon-MwMz.webp)

[The Treaty of Trianon](https://www.rferl.org/a/hungary-treaty-trianon-orban-nations-land-/32911155.html), signed on June 4, 1920, was a peace agreement that reshaped Hungary’s borders after World War I. It resulted in Hungary losing about two-thirds of its territory and one-third of its population to neighboring countries, including Transylvania to Romania, Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia to Czechoslovakia, and Vojvodina to the [Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes](https://www.britannica.com/place/Kingdom-of-Serbs-Croats-and-Slovenes) (which later became Yugoslavia). 

The treaty also imposed military restrictions, limited Hungary’s army size, and created ethnic tensions, as many ethnic Hungarians were outside Hungary’s new borders. Many ethnic Hungarians still live in Serbia, Slovakia, and Romania today. The economic and political fallout was significant, leading to instability and nationalist movements. The treaty remains a deeply controversial and sensitive issue in Hungary, seen by many as unjust and a source of lasting resentment. Many Hungarian nationalists sport the map of Hungary’s pre-Trianon borders; even Hungarian PM [Victor Orban](https://www.euronews.com/2020/05/08/viktor-orban-provokes-neighbours-with-historical-map-of-hungary-thecube) has sported this map himself.
