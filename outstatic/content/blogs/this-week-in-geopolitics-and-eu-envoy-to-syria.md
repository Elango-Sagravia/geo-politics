### THIS WEEK IN GEOPOLITICS

**üåç COP pledges $300 billion:** At COP29 in Baku, delegates reached a [climate finance deal](https://www.dw.com/en/cop29-world-agrees-to-300bn-deal-for-developing-countries/a-70865529), committing developed nations to provide $300 billion annually by 2035 to support poorer countries in tackling climate change. Reactions were mixed; while the EU viewed it as a step forward, India and the [Least Developed Countries](https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/least-developed-country-category.html) labeled it insufficient. UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres stressed the need for swift implementation, calling it a foundation for future efforts. COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev celebrated the agreement despite intense negotiations and delays, stating, ‚ÄúPeople doubted we could deliver.‚Äù

**üá∑üá¥ Romania picks Ultra nationalist:** Ultranationalist Calin Georgescu, a far-right pro-Russia candidate, [led the first round](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dlw5pq967o) of Romania's presidential election with 23% of the vote, surprising many as he initially polled at just 5%. The race for second place is tight, with Elena Lasconi of the center-right Save Romania Union narrowly ahead of Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, who has resigned as Social Democrat leader after his disappointing performance. The December 8 runoff will likely feature Georgescu and Lasconi. Georgescu, backed by George Simion‚Äôs AUR party, has capitalized on nationalist sentiment and opposition to NATO. At the same time, the election has highlighted divisions among voters, particularly Social Democrats, who may hesitate to support the progressive Lasconi.

**üáµüá∞ Thousands march on Karachi:** Thousands of supporters of former Pakistani Prime Minister [Imran Khan](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-19844270) defied heavy police resistance to [march toward Islamabad](https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-lockdown-imran-khan-rally-clashes-belarus-ec6cb96753c83be24b20cd32588ead71), demanding his release. Clashes resulted in one police officer dead and several injured, while tear gas and roadblocks failed to deter protesters. Khan‚Äôs party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), led the march, with his wife, Bushra Bibi, speaking to crowds 30 miles from the capital. Khan has been jailed since August 2023, facing over 150 criminal cases that his party claims are politically motivated. The march coincided with a visit by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, amplifying tensions as the government criticized the demonstrations for negatively impacting Pakistan‚Äôs fragile economy.

**üá∫üá∏ Trump‚Äôs tariff plan**: President-elect Donald Trump plans to impose tariffs of [25% on imports from Mexico and Canada and 10% on Chinese goods](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241126-trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-china), citing national security concerns related to fentanyl smuggling and immigration. He reiterated his trade policies from his first term, and his incoming commerce secretary, [Howard Lutnick](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/19/politics/howard-lutnick-commerce-secretary/index.html), advocates for even higher tariffs on China. Economists warn that these [tariffs](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/27/trump-tariffs-explained) may increase consumer prices and hinder economic growth, while critics believe they could undermine global trade norms. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum downplayed the threat, and retaliatory measures from affected countries are expected, along with potential legal challenges.

**üáÆüá± Ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah:** A [ceasefire](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2d3gj9ewxo) took effect early Wednesday, eliciting mixed [reactions](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c2k0ezg2p3go). In Beirut, some residents are cautiously optimistic, while others express skepticism and call for accountability and rebuilding. In Israel, opinions vary, with some hopeful for peace and the return of displaced residents, while others fear Hezbollah may regroup. The ceasefire does not affect [Gaza](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0j8063plvdo), but President Biden expressed hope for a similar resolution. [Hamas](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hamas-says-group-ready-for-gaza-ceasefire-after-hezbollah-appears-to-lay-down-arms/) has indicated readiness for a ceasefire, and the U.S. aims for the Lebanon truce to pressure Hamas into concessions, though Israel's broader goals in Gaza remain unresolved.

### THE BIG QUESTION

**Why is the EU making an envoy to Syria?**

The European Union (EU) is establishing a [special envoy](https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/europe/2024/10/28/eu-commission-to-appoint-special-envoy-to-syria-amid-push-for-refugee-returns/) to Syria to help navigate the country's and the broader region's complex and evolving situation. Some EU members support this move as an easy way to deal with [Syrian migration](https://english.aawsat.com/arab-world/5075913-eu-preparing-appoint-envoy-syria-address-migration-crisis), while others want a strengthened EU presence.

Syrian activists and refugees [argue](https://www.dw.com/en/eu-syria-foreign-policy-special-envoy-bashar-assad-government-v2/a-70890825) that any move to engage with Assad, even through a special envoy, could be interpreted as an EU endorsement of a regime that has been accused of war crimes, including chemical attacks on civilians and severe repression of political dissent. They fear it could weaken international pressure for accountability and justice for the crimes committed by [Assad](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bashar-al-Assad) and his government. Many Syrian refugees worry that this will further the drive to send some of them back home. The lack of action from the EU in the past towards Syria drives this anger, so some of them are wondering why now.

One reason for supporting it is that the Syrian conflict involves multiple [international players](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/syria-conflict-assad-putin-russia-iran-israel), including Russia, Iran, and Turkey, and these actors have challenged the EU‚Äôs influence in the region. A special envoy could strengthen the EU‚Äôs diplomatic presence, enabling it to assert its role in any future peace process and ensure that European interests are represented in discussions about Syria‚Äôs future.

### TODAY AGO

On this day in 1939, after Finland rejected Soviet demands in late 1939, the Soviet Union invaded, igniting the [Russo-Finnish War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Finnish-War), or Winter War. Finland‚Äôs smaller forces defended against the larger but disorganized Soviet army using guerrilla tactics and their knowledge of the harsh winter terrain. Despite their resistance, Finland ultimately signed the [Moscow Peace Treaty](https://www.prlib.ru/en/history/619090) in March 1940, ceding significant territory while maintaining its independence.
