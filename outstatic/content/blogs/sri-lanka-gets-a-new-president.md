### New Sri Lankan President

Sri Lanka's new president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, was [sworn](https://www.dw.com/en/new-sri-lanka-president-anura-kumara-dissanayake-sworn-in/a-70297993) in on Monday following a decisive victory sparked by public demand for change after the country's worst economic crisis in over 70 years. Promising to combat corruption and support economic recovery, Dissanayake emphasized the need for more transparent politics. His party, the National People's Power (NPP), traditionally focused on Marxist principles, has recently adopted more centrist views to become more appealing to a broader range of voters.

NPP has only occupied three seats in the 225-member parliament. This will add to the new president's challenges, including forming a new cabinet and passing a budget tied to a $2.9 billion IMF bailout. Investors are slightly skeptical of his Marxist leanings. Dissanayake's win has garnered congratulations from neighboring countries and China, which hopes for stability in Sri Lanka.

In 2022, Sri Lanka faced a severe political and [economic crisis](https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/sri-lanka/341-sri-lankas-bailout-blues-elections-aftermath-economic-collapse) caused by a shortage of foreign reserves, leading to critical shortages of fuel and medicine. Mismanagement, heavy debt, and the impact of COVID-19 made things worse. Mass protests demanded President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation, and in July, protesters stormed his residence, forcing him to flee and step down. Ranil Wickremesinghe took over as acting president but lost the 2024 elections to the new president.

### Zelensky Starts His US Trip

During his visit to the U.S., Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is preparing to share his "victory plan" with President Biden, Vice President Harris, and former President Trump while keeping his political preferences private. This trip comes after a summer marked by intense fighting, with Russia advancing in Eastern Ukraine. Zelensky began his visit at a factory in Pennsylvania, where he expressed gratitude to workers for increasing artillery shell production.

His primary aim is to persuade Biden to approve the use of [long-range missiles](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/22/europe/ukraine-western-long-range-weapons-russia-intl/index.html) against Russia. With the next few weeks being critical for the war's outcome, Zelensky also intends to invite Russia to a potential [peace summit](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/07/17/war-in-ukraine-zelensky-wants-russia-to-take-part-in-a-new-peace-summit_6687222_4.html) in November, although Moscow appears reluctant to participate.

### Israel Air Strike on Lebanon

The situation in Lebanon has sharply [intensified](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kdg7jwvz7o), marking Monday as one of the bloodiest days since Hezbollah’s war with Israel in 2006. Israel's airstrikes have reportedly killed 492 people, with more attacks on the horizon. The Israeli military is urging civilians to evacuate targeted areas, including the Bekaa Valley, a known Hezbollah stronghold.

Over 100,000 Lebanese have already been displaced due to ongoing strikes. While the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has deep historical roots, the current escalation follows the [October 7 Hamas attacks](https://www.csis.org/analysis/hamass-october-7-attack-visualizing-data). U.S. and U.K. allies believe that a ceasefire in Gaza is crucial for easing tensions, but both sides show little interest in negotiations, raising concerns about furthering regional destabilization.

### UN Reform Plan Passes without Russia’s Approval

At the Summit of the Future in New York, countries adopted a ["Pact for the Future"](https://x.com/UN/status/1837849571071803530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1837849571071803530%7Ctwgr%5E6b30ad1800de94cf4facb6eb0648f6e846ea8cd7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dw.com%2Fen%2Fun-reform-plan-adopted-despite-russian-opposition%2Fa-70295441) to tackle 21st-century challenges despite Russia's pushback. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called it a "once-in-a-generation opportunity" to boost global cooperation. The pact outlines 56 actions, focusing on reforming the UN, fighting climate change, and achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

While Russia tried to stall the agreement with demands for amendments, those efforts were rejected. The Democratic Republic of the Congo helped move past Russia’s objections, allowing the pact to be adopted and signaling a strong commitment to collaboration. The UN has been looking to make other reforms to give more countries a more prominent voice.

### Iran Arrested 12 People for Collaborating with Israel

Iranian authorities announced the [arrest of 12 individuals](https://www.timesofisrael.com/irans-irgc-says-it-arrested-12-people-for-alleged-collaboration-with-israel/) accused of collaborating with Israel, as reported by local media. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) stated that these arrests took place across six provinces, though specific dates and locations were not provided. The accused were allegedly planning actions against Iran's security.

Iran frequently claims to arrest individuals linked to foreign espionage, particularly involving Israel, which it blames for sabotage at its nuclear sites and the assassination of scientists. In recent months, several individuals convicted of collaboration with Israel’s Mossad have been executed, underscoring Tehran's commitment to responding to perceived threats.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is ECOWAS?** 

![](/images/what-is-ecowas--M5Nz.webp)

The [Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)](https://www.ecowas.int/about-ecowas/) is a regional political and economic union of 15 West African countries, established in 1975 in Lagos, Nigeria. Its primary aim is to promote economic integration and cooperation among member states, enhancing trade and investment to foster sustainable development. 

ECOWAS also focuses on peace and security, intervening in regional conflicts and political crises. The organization has played a crucial role in mediation and peacekeeping missions, particularly in Liberia and Sierra Leone. ECOWAS has implemented initiatives like the ECOWAS Common External Tariff and the ECOWAS Single Currency project to strengthen economic ties. Additionally, it addresses issues such as human rights, environmental challenges, and public health, striving for a stable and prosperous West Africa.

There has been some strain among the group lately, as several members announced this year that they would leave to form their Sahel Alliance. The group also faces a series of challenges, ranging from violent extremism to political instability and deadly viruses.
