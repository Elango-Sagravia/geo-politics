Countries like Peru, Chile, and Brazil are ramping up border security in response.

As violent protests erupt in Caracas and economic instability deepens, the region braces for a potential humanitarian crisis.

Economists are divided on the outlook, with some predicting slower growth while others remain optimistic.
