### Israel Launches Ground Offensive in Lebanon

Israel has launched a [ground offensive](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/01/middleeast/israel-ground-incursion-lebanon-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html) into southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah militants in response to ongoing rocket fire and the recent killing of Hezbollah leader [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25348/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-hassan-nasrallah-timeline). The offensive has led to significant displacement on both sides of the border and has further escalated the conflict, with thousands of civilians affected. Hezbollah has been launching rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas, which has also prompted Israeli air and ground strikes.

While the U.S. [supports](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/30/us-israel-military-hezbollah-00181797) Israel’s right to defend itself, it has cautioned against broadening the conflict. Washington has troops on standby but is wary of being drawn deeper into the fighting. Diplomatic efforts, including ceasefire talks, have been sidelined as the situation intensifies. The conflict’s escalation has also fueled misinformation and conspiracy theories, deepening [divisions](https://eastside-online.org/global-commentary/how-social-media-polarizes-americas-views-on-the-israel-hamas-war/) among global audiences.

### Iran Launches Missile Strikes Amid Israeli Offensive

Following Israel’s ground offensive in Lebanon, Iran responded with [missile strikes](https://www.dw.com/en/middle-east-iran-launches-missiles-at-israel/live-70370002) aimed at Israeli military positions. Iran’s retaliation follows the killing of high-ranking Hezbollah, IRGC, and Hamas leaders in Israeli airstrikes. This time, Iran deployed advanced ballistic missiles to increase precision and minimize Israel’s response time.

Both the EU and the U.S. have condemned the missile strikes, with [Washington warning Tehran](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/10/01/iran-israel-biden/) of severe consequences if the situation escalates further. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has defended the strikes as defensive, but the region braces for potential further escalation as tensions between Israel, Iran, and Hezbollah show no signs of cooling.

### Mark Rutte Takes Charge as NATO Secretary-General

The former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has assumed the role of [NATO Secretary-General](https://www.dw.com/en/nato-chief-mark-rutte-takes-charge-at-critical-time/a-70355945), succeeding Jens Stoltenberg. In his first address, Rutte called for increased defense spending among NATO allies and reaffirmed NATO’s strong support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. He also emphasized the importance of enhancing partnerships with Indo-Pacific allies amid growing concerns over China's influence in the region.

Rutte's appointment comes at a crucial time as NATO navigates multiple challenges, including the ongoing war in Ukraine and the Middle East's instability. Rutte’s experience and political clout are expected to help NATO steer through these complex issues, though he will also face pressure to manage the alliance’s response to rising global tensions.

### Orban Threatens to Send Migrants to Brussels

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has [threatened](https://www.politico.eu/article/viktor-orban-migrants-hungary-gates-brussels-main-square-grand-place/) to send migrants to Brussels in response to a European Court of Justice ruling that fined Hungary [€200 million for breaking EU asylum laws](https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-fined-200-million-breaking-eu-migration-unprecedented-serious-asylum-rules-european-court-justice-viktor-orban/). Orbán criticized the court's decision, saying it punished Hungary for protecting Europe's borders. He announced plans to send migrants trying to enter Hungary to Brussels to protest the ruling. 

This idea, inspired by U.S. Republican tactics, follows the court's order for Hungary to abandon its restrictive refugee detention policies. Belgian officials have condemned Orbán’s proposal as a provocation, while Orbán insists the EU is unfairly targeting Hungary despite Western European countries tightening their border controls.

### Austria's Far-Right Party Wins Big in National Election

Austria's far-right Freedom Party (FPO) has achieved a sizable [victory](https://www.politico.eu/article/austria-far-right-freedom-party-win-national-election-early-projections-herbet-kickl/) in the recent national [parliamentary election](https://www.presidentialsummary.com/archives/israel-strikes-yemen-harris-promises-border-solutions), securing 29% of the vote, a record for the party. This marks the first time since World War II that a party with Nazi roots has won a national ballot in Austria. The FPO, led by Herbert Kickl, campaigned on an anti-migrant, nationalist platform, promising to create a "Fortress Austria" and aligning itself with Hungary's Viktor Orbán.

Other far-right parties in Europe welcome these results; [Marine Le Pen](https://apnews.com/article/france-eu-election-far-right-1c9bba84aa8ace2619c307b933385473) of France’s National Rally lauded the FPO's success as part of a broader movement for national sovereignty.  Other leaders echoed this sentiment, suggesting the FPO's win signals a shift toward identity, security, and anti-immigration policies across the continent. Other countries with far-right parties, such as [the Netherlands](https://www.politico.eu/article/geert-wilders-dutch-society-far-right-voters-migration-refugees-housing-crisis-freedom-party/), have seen significant gains in the last year.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is Nagorno Karabakh?**

![Nagorno Karabakh](/images/_what-is-nagorno-karabakh--Y4Mz.webp)

Nagorno-Karabakh is a mountainous, landlocked region in the South Caucasus that has been at the center of a [territorial conflict](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18270325) between Armenia and Azerbaijan for decades. Officially part of Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh has a majority ethnic Armenian population that has sought independence or unification with Armenia. The conflict dates back to the early 20th century but escalated in the late 1980s during the decline of the Soviet Union. The region declared independence in 1991, sparking the Nagorno-Karabakh War, which resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and displacement on both sides.

Although a ceasefire was brokered in 1994, tensions remained, and a new war erupted in 2020. This conflict, known as the [Second Nagorno-Karabakh War](https://www.c-r.org/news-and-insight/analysing-second-karabakh-war), ended with Azerbaijan reclaiming large parts of the territory. Russia brokered a ceasefire agreement, deploying peacekeepers to the region, but the situation remains fragile. The unresolved status of Nagorno-Karabakh reflects broader regional geopolitical tensions involving Russia, Turkey, and Iran, all of whom have interests in the South Caucasus. The conflict also illustrates the legacies of Soviet-era policies, where borders were often drawn to stoke ethnic divisions, leading to prolonged instability in post-Soviet states.
