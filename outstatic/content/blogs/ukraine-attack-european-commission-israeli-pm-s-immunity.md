### Ukraine energy facilities under attack

A Russian [aerial assault](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241128-ukraine-s-energy-facilities-under-massive-enemy-attack-minister-says) on Ukraine‚Äôs energy infrastructure has left over a million households without power, marking the 11th major attack on its energy supplies this year. The strikes targeted facilities nationwide, including Kyiv, Lviv, and Odesa. This forced the national power grid operator Ukrenergo to introduce emergency power cuts. The attack might force the Ukrainians to encounter a severe winter as the temperatures drop below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. President Volodymyr Zelensky reported the attack involved over 90 missiles and 100 drones, urging allies to bolster Ukraine‚Äôs air defenses.¬†

Russia [justifies](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy15lp21l3o) the bombardment based on the claim it is retaliating for Ukraine‚Äôs use of US-supplied [ATACMS](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2nrlq1840o) missiles on Russian territory. President Vladimir Putin threatens to attack Kyiv‚Äôs ‚Äòdecision-making centers‚Äô with [Oreshnik](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/UKRAINE-CRISIS/RUSSIA-MISSILE/gdpzknajgvw/), which he claims to be immune to counterattacks. Both Ukraine and Russia are taking hard blows this month in the war. While both sides have signaled they want peace soon, the conditions for the peace remain an issue of contention.¬†

### EP approves the European Commission¬†

![European Parliament approves Ursula von der Leyen‚Äôs Commission](/images/the-european-parliament-has-approved-the-new-european-commission-team-led-by-ursula-von-der-leyen.--1--UxNz.webp)

The European Parliament has [approved](https://www.dw.com/en/eu-lawmakers-greenlight-von-der-leyens-top-team/a-70899620) the new European Commission, led by Ursula von der Leyen, with 370 votes in favor, 282 against, and 36 abstentions. Most of the approval came from Center-Right and Centrist members. The team of 26 commissioners will officially begin work on December 1, focusing on critical challenges, including the war in Ukraine, rising economic competition from China, and defense spending. Von der Leyen emphasized the need for urgent action to boost the EU‚Äôs sovereignty and security, citing concerns over the bloc‚Äôs low defense spending compared to Moscow.

Key appointments include Estonia‚Äôs Kaja Kallas as the EU‚Äôs top diplomat, Lithuania‚Äôs Andrius Kubilius managing space and defense, and Slovakia‚Äôs Maros Sefcovic overseeing trade policy amid U.S. political shifts. France‚Äôs Stephane Sejourne will handle industrial strategy to address manufacturing and energy cost challenges. The Commission will lead legislative proposals for the bloc, with final approval from member states considered a formality.

### France provides immunity to Israeli PM

France has stated it will [continue](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/27/france-says-israels-netanyahu-has-immunity-from-icc-arrest-warrant) its cooperation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu despite the recent ICC arrest [warrant](https://www.reuters.com/world/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-israels-netanyahu-gallant-hamas-leader-2024-11-21/). The French foreign ministry argued Netanyahu has immunity from the warrant as Israel is not an ICC member, signaling it would not arrest him if requested by the ICC. Part of the reason is that France brokered the recent ceasefire with Hezbollah-Israel.¬†

This stance aligns with France‚Äôs emphasis on its ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù with Israel and its broader geopolitical goals. Still, it has drawn criticism from human rights organizations for undermining international justice. The issue shows divisions among European nations regarding respect to ICC rulings. France has a complicated relationship with Israel. France is home to one of the largest Jewish populations in Europe and also one of the largest Muslim populations.

**üá≤üá≤ Myanmar:** The ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has sought an[ arrest warrant](https://www.dw.com/en/myanmar-icc-prosecutor-seeks-arrest-warrant-for-junta-chief/a-70897488) for Myanmar's junta leader, Min Aung Hlaing, citing crimes against humanity against the Rohingya Muslim minority. These [actions](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41566561), occurring in 2016‚Äì2017, resulted in 730,000 Rohingya people fleeing to Bangladesh. This marks the first arrest warrant application for a senior Myanmar official. Although Myanmar isn‚Äôt an ICC signatory, jurisdiction was established because the crimes occurred partially in Bangladesh, an ICC member. This highlights international efforts to hold Myanmar's military accountable amid ongoing civil war and Rohingya persecution.

**üá®üá≥ China:** China has [suspended](https://apnews.com/article/china-military-official-investigation-4c38fcbf89b8ed8a31c7774ce448d6f5) Miao Hua, the director of the Political Work Department on the Central Military Commission (CMC), amid an investigation for ‚Äúserious violations of discipline,‚Äù a term often associated with corruption. Miao is a senior figure in the CMC, which oversees the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) and is chaired by President Xi Jinping. His suspension follows similar cases involving former defense ministers Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe, highlighting ongoing anti-corruption campaigns within the PLA under Xi‚Äôs leadership. These purges, though frequent, are unlikely to affect Xi‚Äôs control as he maintains a firm grip on power.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why do some ICC members avoid arresting someone with an ICC arrest warrant?**

![ICC members face challenges balancing warrants with strategic interests](/images/why-do-some-icc-members-avoid-arresting-someone-with-an-icc-arrest-warrent_--1--MwMD.webp)

This issue has frequently come up in the last week; the European Union is divided on the subject of the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu and ex-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over war crimes in Gaza. While the entire EU is a member of the ICC and is obliged to arrest the men, it remains a divided subject. Some [EU members](https://www.politico.eu/article/benjamin-netanyahu-arrest-warrant-war-crimes-gaza-travel-arrest-europe/) are happy to cuff them, while France has stressed immunity for Netanyahu, and Hungary has decided to welcome him to Hungary with open arms. A similar situation happened a couple of months ago when Mongolia, also an ICC member, did not [arrest](https://apnews.com/article/mongolia-russia-putin-international-criminal-court-warrant-4c79850ecf409287924e3d96218abc78) Vladimir Putin, who also has a warrant.¬†

It‚Äôs not as simple. Some countries may have strategic alliances or interests with the individual subject of an ICC arrest warrant. Some of these subjects are from countries that are not members of the ICC, which complicates it further. Some disagree with the premise of the arrest warrant and find inconsistencies. Some wonder why Netanyahu got a warrant, and Basher Al-Assad didn‚Äôt. An argument can be made as to why George W. Bush did not receive one. This can turn into a cycle of [whataboutism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/whataboutism). Some members may be influenced by countries that are not ICC members or oppose the court. For instance, the United States has long criticized the ICC and has pressured various states not to comply with its mandates.¬†
