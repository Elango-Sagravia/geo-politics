### Pager attack fallout

![Explosions of pagers in Hezbollah strongholds confirm Israeli strikes in Lebanon](/images/israel-pm-acknowledges-approval-of-hezbollah-pager-attack-k5ND.webp)

Israel has confirmed that Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu [personally approved](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20241111-israeli-pm-office-confirms-netanyahu-approved-lebanon-pager-attacks) attacks in Lebanon in September, targeting Hezbollah communication devices, leading to 39 deaths and over 3,400 injuries. Thousands of [pagers](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/27/middleeast/israel-pager-attack-hezbollah-lebanon-invs-intl/index.html) exploded across Hezbollah strongholds, reportedly after receiving incoming messages, followed by a second wave involving weaponized walkie-talkies. Many victims suffered severe injuries from the blasts.

The Israeli military initially declined to comment on the detonations. Reports indicate that senior officials had opposed the operation, but Netanyahu proceeded, justifying the attacks as a significant blow to Hezbollah. The incidents mark one of Hezbollah‚Äôs most severe security breaches in recent years. Israel subsequently intensified its operations by targeting Hezbollah leader [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wnp0vln19o) in an airstrike and conducting incursions in southern Lebanon. Israel also continues to make [strikes](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6v3zq2jvjo) in Southern Lebanon and Northern Gaza.¬†

### On the streets of Amsterdam

In Amsterdam, dozens of people armed with sticks and firecrackers set a tram [on fire](https://www.dw.com/en/dutch-tram-set-on-fire-in-new-amsterdam-unrest/a-70759392) Monday at the ‚Äô40-‚Äô45 Square, though the tram was empty and no injuries were reported. The incident follows [clashes](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgv4mdr9y8o) between Israeli football fans and locals last week during a match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax Amsterdam. Some [fact-checks](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-amsterdam-video-doesnt-show-attack-on-israelis/a-70763374) revealed that football fans were also part of the violence, so neither side is vindicated.¬†

Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof condemned the violence, calling it an ‚Äúantisemitic attack.‚Äù Both sides are calling foul. The Netherlands is very politically polarized at the moment. They have a sizeable right-wing party that [took power](https://www.politico.eu/article/netherlands-right-wing-government-dick-schoof-mark-rutte-party-for-freedom/); they blame many social problems on migration. Many of those who feel disenfranchised by the right advocate for Palestine and have taken extreme measures in their advocacy, there are other people sympathetic to the Palestinian cause who favor a more objective and fair solution to Dutch foreign policy.

### Saudi tries to intervene in Israel

At an [Arab-Islamic summit](https://www.dw.com/en/dutch-tram-set-on-fire-in-new-amsterdam-unrest/a-70759392) held in Riyadh, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) called for an immediate halt to Israel's military actions in Gaza and Lebanon, describing the violence as a ‚Äúmassacre.‚Äù MBS advocated for global recognition of Palestinian statehood and strongly condemned Israel‚Äôs actions.¬†

Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit emphasized that peace could only be attained through justice for the Palestinians. Lebanon‚Äôs Prime Minister Najib Mikati cautioned that the crisis with Hezbollah represented an ‚Äúexistential‚Äù threat to Lebanon. The closing statement of the summit condemned Israel's actions as potentially amounting to ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù and reaffirmed support for Palestinian sovereignty, designating East Jerusalem as its capital. However, while a lot of the Middle East has given [vocal support](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/02/21/why-arab-states-wont-support-palestinians-qa-00142277) to Palestine, there hasn‚Äôt been much action from many vital actors to work towards a sustainable plan for peace.

**üá≠üáπ Haiti:** Haiti‚Äôs [newly sworn-in](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241111-haiti-swears-in-new-pm-as-gang-violence-briefly-shuts-down-international-airport) Prime Minister, Alix Didier Fils-Aim√©, took office amid intense [violence in Port-au-Prince](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241113-us-prohibits-flights-to-haiti-amid-rampant-gang-violence-rages). Gangs opened fire at a Spirit Airlines flight landing from Fort Lauderdale, injuring a flight attendant and forcing the plane to divert to the Dominican Republic. The U.S. Embassy attributed the incident to gang efforts to disrupt travel to and from the capital. Meanwhile, clashes between gangs and police erupted, with gangs setting fire to homes in affluent areas, prompting schools to close. This turmoil follows the recent [dismissal of interim Prime Minister](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/g-s1-33654/haiti-prime-minister-garry-conille) Garry Conille by Haiti‚Äôs transitional council, which was formed to restore democratic order.

**üá¨üá™ Georgia:** Thousands of opposition supporters [rallied](https://apnews.com/article/georgia-opposition-protest-election-eu-russia-2ffe964513ec147d6d4e128bd212fd52) in Tbilisi, Georgia, to protest the ruling Georgian Dream party‚Äôs claimed victory in the October parliamentary election, which they assert was rigged with [Russian involvement](https://www.voanews.com/a/accused-of-interference-in-georgia-russia-pumps-up-anti-us-propaganda-/7846721.html). Demonstrators, waving Georgian and EU flags, demanded new elections under international supervision and an investigation into alleged fraud. Opposition leader Giorgi Vashadze vowed to continue protests until a new government is formed. While the Central Election Commission confirmed Georgian Dream‚Äôs 54% win, critics condemned the party for increasing authoritarianism and pro-Russian policies. President Salome Zourabichvili also rejected the results, calling for EU and U.S. support, as European lawmakers showed solidarity at the rally.

### FOUNDATIONS

**How dependent is Europe on Russian gas?**

![Europe's reliance on Russian gas dropped from 40% to 8% in 2023 due to the Ukraine invasion](/images/how-dependent-is-the-eu-on-russian-gas_-cyOD.webp)

Europe‚Äôs dependence on Russian natural gas has historically been substantial, though it has declined significantly since 2022 due to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing energy policy shifts. The dependency on gas varies from country to country.

Russia has comprised [40%](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/eu-gas-supply/) of total EU gas imports before 2022. His figure dropped to around 8 in 2023. Major pipelines like Nord Stream 1 and Yamal-Europe supplied gas directly to Germany, Italy, and Eastern European nations. The dependency on Russian gas was exceptionally high in Germany, Italy, and several Eastern European countries, which relied on Russia for secure, large-scale deliveries.

In response to sanctions and political tensions, Russia [reduced](https://ecfr.eu/article/own-goal-how-russias-gas-war-has-backfired/) its gas exports to Europe, which, combined with damage to infrastructure like the Nord Stream pipelines, forced Europe to seek new suppliers. Since then, European countries have aggressively diversified their energy sources, increasing gas imports from the U.S., Norway, Qatar, and North Africa.
