### Dhaka in Turmoil as PM Hasina Flees

In a shocking turn of events, Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has fled the country, seeking refuge in New Delhi after a weekend marked by intense protests and escalating violence. What began as student protests over job quota policies has spiraled into a full-blown crisis, threatening the very stability of Hasina's government and plunging the nation into uncertainty.

### Roots of the Student Protests

The unrest was initially triggered by student demands to reform a controversial quota system for government jobs. The current system reserves 36% of jobs for the descendants of "freedom fighters," a policy that has been increasingly criticized as outdated and unfair. Protesters argue that this system, which originally set aside 30% of jobs but has expanded over time, disproportionately benefits a small, elite group, exacerbating job competition and high unemployment rates among the broader population.

Opposition parties and students alike view the quota as unconstitutional, perpetuating inequality rather than addressing it. They are calling for the reservation to be restricted to ethnic minorities and people with disabilities, rather than extending it to the descendants of freedom fighters. The recent Supreme Court decision to uphold the quota, despite legislative efforts to remove it, has further inflamed public anger.

### Government’s Heavy-Handed Response

The crisis intensified over the weekend, with nearly 100 people losing their lives in violent clashes between protesters and police forces. In a bid to regain control, the military has imposed an indefinite curfew and shut down mobile internet access nationwide. Schools and colleges have been closed as tensions continue to rise.

The government's response has been widely criticized, with former army chief General Ikbal Karim Bhuiyan openly condemning the military’s involvement and calling for their withdrawal. The current military leadership's support for the protesters has only added fuel to the fire, deepening the divide and challenging the government’s authority.

### Sheikh Hasina’s Dramatic Exit

Faced with mounting pressure and widespread condemnation, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled Bangladesh via a military helicopter. She has reportedly landed at an Indian Air Force base near New Delhi, marking a dramatic exit that underscores the severity of the crisis. Hasina, once celebrated as a key figure in Bangladesh’s independence, is now being labeled a dictator by an increasingly disillusioned public, angered by her government’s oppressive tactics.

### Reactions and the Road Ahead

The international community has reacted swiftly, with the UN Secretary-General calling on the Bangladeshi government to avoid further violence against protesters. As the military takes control of the situation, discussions are underway about forming an interim government, possibly with the inclusion of opposition parties.

With Sheikh Hasina’s departure and the military now at the helm, Bangladesh’s future remains uncertain. The protests have not only exposed deep dissatisfaction with the quota system but have also revealed broader grievances against the government. The world will be watching closely to see if a peaceful resolution can be found, or if the country is headed for further unrest.
