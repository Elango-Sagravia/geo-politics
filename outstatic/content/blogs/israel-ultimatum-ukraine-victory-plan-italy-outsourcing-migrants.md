### US Gives Israel a Deadline

![The U.S. gives Israel 30 days to enhance humanitarian aid access in Gaza or face military assistance cuts](/images/middle-east--us-gives-israel-30-days-to-boost-gaza-aid-I4ND.webp)

The U.S. has reportedly issued a diplomatic message to Israel, giving it 30 days to [improve humanitarian aid](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wk0e8zey2o) access in Gaza significantly, or it will face potential cuts to U.S. military assistance. In a letter signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the U.S. expressed concerns over Israel’s restrictions on aid to northern Gaza, where civilians are at risk due to overcrowding and lack of supplies.

The U.S. has called on Israel to facilitate the entry of 350 aid trucks daily and allow freedom of movement for civilians, warning of legal consequences if humanitarian aid remains blocked. The letter highlighted how U.S. laws could limit military assistance to nations impeding humanitarian aid. This notion stresses the worsening [conditions in Gaza](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/humanitarian-situation-update-229-gaza-strip-enarhe), particularly in the heavily bombed north. The U.S. called for Israel to lift restrictions on aid delivery and guarantee that civilians in northern Gaza are not forcibly evacuated, urging swift action before winter.

### Ukraine Victory Plan 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky presented his [“victory plan”](https://www.politico.eu/article/volodymyr-zelenskyy-presents-his-victory-plan-to-ukraine-parliament-war-vladimir-putin/) to parliament, aiming for a just peace through strengthened defense and security guarantees. The plan includes five significant points: an invitation to NATO, accelerated arms deliveries, a strategic deterrence package, economic collaboration with the EU and U.S. on resources, and a post-war vision where Ukraine strengthens European security. 

Zelensky emphasizes that Russian negotiations are futile and that future peace depends on Ukraine’s allies. Reactions to this plan vary; some consider it overly ambitious, while others praise it as a potential diplomatic breakthrough.​ NATO hasn’t pledged membership but has pledged money and aid to Ukraine. Zelesnky has [voiced frustrations](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-bridle-no-holds-barred-us-support-israel/) with how Israel gets more approval for weapons use than Ukraine.

### Martinique Riots Over Prices

Last month, the French Caribbean island of Martinique experienced intense [protests and riots](https://www.caribbeanlife.com/martinique-erupts-over-inflation/) due to rising food prices and inflation. Residents have accused the French government of indifference, as the prices of essential items like milk and meat have surged by 40% over the past year. 

The unrest escalated when protestors clashed with police, looted stores, and attempted to storm the island’s airport, leading to flight cancellations and the imposition of a curfew. French anti-riot forces were deployed, which further heightened tensions. Local leaders sympathized with the protestors and called for solutions to address the economic crisis. As a result, authorities in Martinique have [extended the nighttime curfew](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241016-authorities-extend-curfew-in-france-s-martinique-after-riots) until October 21.

### Niger Breaks With France

Niger’s junta held a significant ceremony to officially rename Avenue General Charles de Gaulle to Avenue Djibo Bakary, symbolizing a profound [departure from colonial history](https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20241016-niger-renames-its-historic-places-to-sever-ties-with-french-colonial-past). This change comes in the wake of the [military coup in July 2023](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/niger-coup-reversing-hard-earned-gains/), during which the junta not only severed long-standing ties with France but also forged alliances with other military governments in the region, specifically in Burkina Faso and Mali, as well as with Russia. 

The renaming ceremony was marked by a vibrant display attended by high-ranking junta officials and local dignitaries. It featured impressive marching bands that enhanced the celebratory atmosphere. The event was intended to honor nationally recognized heroes, reinforcing the junta's commitment to redefining Niger’s identity and fostering a sense of national pride. This initiative reflects a broader [movement against colonialism](https://library.fiveable.me/key-terms/ap-world/anti-colonial-movement), resonating with rising anti-imperialist sentiments across the region as the junta seeks to distance itself from its former colonial ties.

### Italy Outsourcing Migrants

An Italian navy ship docked in Albania’s Shengjin port, bringing [16 migrants](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/16/world/italy-first-migrants-albania-intl/index.html) rescued from the Mediterranean. This is the first delivery under a new [Italian-Albanian deal](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/09/europe/italy-migrants-albania-centers-intl-cmd/index.html) to process up to 3,000 adult men monthly in Albania to alleviate Italy’s asylum system. Migrants, mainly from Bangladesh and Egypt, will be screened and housed in Albania, while vulnerable groups, such as women and children, will remain in Italy. The five-year agreement, costing Italy €670 million, has received praise and criticism.

Claims are initially screened on Italian ships and then reviewed in Albania, with approved cases relocated to Italy and denied cases facing deportation. While EU leaders view this as an innovative solution, human rights organizations warn it is a dangerous outsourcing of responsibilities. Despite a 61% decline in migrant numbers in 2024, migration continues to be a contentious issue.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is UNIFIL?**

![UNIFIL is a UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, established in 1978 to maintain stability and support humanitarian efforts](/images/what-is-unifil--the-peacekeeping-force-on-the-israel-lebanon-border--k0MD.webp)

[UNIFIL](https://unifil.unmissions.org/), or the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, was established in 1978 as a peacekeeping mission to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon. Tasked with maintaining stability along the Lebanon-Israel border, UNIFIL plays a crucial role in monitoring ceasefire agreements between conflicting parties. 

 The mission actively supports humanitarian efforts, providing essential aid and resources to local communities impacted by conflict. It also fosters dialogue between opposing groups, seeking to build bridges and promote understanding in a region marked by division and strife. Additionally, UNIFIL helps the Lebanese government assert its sovereignty, strengthens governmental authority, and reduces the likelihood of violent confrontations.

Over the years, UNIFIL’s mandate has evolved in response to shifting dynamics, particularly with the rise of Hezbollah and [ongoing regional tensions](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/14/middleeast/unifil-peacekeeping-force-israel-lebanon-explainer/index.html). The force has encountered significant challenges, facing scrutiny over its effectiveness in maintaining peace and ensuring the safety of its personnel. Recent [attacks on UNIFIL](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/14/un-security-council-says-unifil-must-be-protected-after-days-of-israeli-attacks) members have highlighted the precarious security situation, raising questions about the mission's ability to uphold its objectives in a complex and volatile environment.
