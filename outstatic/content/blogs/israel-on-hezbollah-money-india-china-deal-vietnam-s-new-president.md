### Israel Targets Hezbollah Finances

The United Nations condemned Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon targeting Hezbollah‚Äôs [financial infrastructure](https://www.dw.com/en/un-condemns-damage-from-israeli-strikes-in-beirut/live-70548957), including the Al-Qard Al-Hassan association, which Israel claims funds Hezbollah‚Äôs attacks. Israel stated that it struck an underground [vault](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3283296/hezbollah-cash-vault-hit-israeli-army-says-it-seeks-degrade-movements-funding) containing millions of dollars and gold used to finance the group.¬†

The UN criticized the strikes for causing significant damage to civilian areas, urging respect for international humanitarian law, and expressed concern over the impact on civilians, including panic and displacement.

While things with Israel and Lebanon remain heated, U.S. Secretary of State [Antony Blinken](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20241021-blinken-heading-to-israel-other-countries-in-middle-east-this-week-state-department/) is in the Middle East this week. His mission is to discuss the ongoing conflict in Gaza, focusing on ending hostilities, securing the release of hostages, and addressing the humanitarian crisis faced by Palestinians. He will stress delivering humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza and explore diplomatic resolutions to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Many aren‚Äôt optimistic about a change, as his [last visits](https://apnews.com/article/blinken-israel-gaza-a022fea284a40272e65f3ba7752eb9fb) yielded little results.¬†

### India-China Border Deal

India and China have reached an agreement on patrolling arrangements along their [disputed Himalayan border,](https://apnews.com/article/india-china-ladakh-border-standoff-c7c5fcf61b2378428842207b52b547c3) following talks to reduce tensions that escalated into [deadly clashes](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-54067400) in 2020. The agreement aims to ensure disengagement and resolve ongoing issues at the Line of Actual Control, which separates their territories. Read more about the India-China dispute [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53062484).

While specifics of the arrangement remain unclear, it is seen as a step towards easing strained relations between the two nations ahead of India‚Äôs Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs upcoming visit to Russia for the [BRICS summit](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/brics-summit-moldova-votes-yes-israel-documents-leaked). The relationship between China and India is complex aside from the territorial disputes, as both are major rival powers in Asia. However, this has not always been the case [(watch video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeXzB53Xu08). Relations between China and India started warm in the 1950s after the foundation of Modern China and India‚Äôs independence.¬†

### Vietnam Appoints New President

Vietnam has officially elected General Luong Cuong as its [new president](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/21/asia/vietnam-new-president-luong-cuong-intl-hnk/index.html), marking a significant leadership change as he becomes the fourth individual to assume this role in just 18 months. General Cuong brings over 40 years of experience in the military, including various leadership positions within the armed forces.¬†

Although the presidency in Vietnam is primarily a ceremonial role, Cuong has expressed a strong commitment to pursuing and enhancing the country's foreign policies, particularly those that emphasize independence and peace on the global stage.

His appointment comes amid political instability, raising concerns about Vietnam's political landscape [(watch video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ1Jhds2ayk). Observers view his selection as a strategic move to consolidate power ahead of the [2026 Party Congress](https://vietnamnews.vn/politics-laws/1665251/14th-national-party-congress-organising-sub-committee-convenes-2nd-meeting.html). However, critics argue that Cuong‚Äôs deep ties to the military could exacerbate issues related to government repression, casting doubts on whether his presidency will truly lead to increased stability or further unrest.

**üá∑üá∏ Serbia:** Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, after a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, reaffirmed Serbia‚Äôs [refusal to impose sanctions](https://apnews.com/article/russia-serbia-putin-vucic-05869fb76769f8bc42e6e7980c11b571) on Russia despite pressure from the European Union. Vucic emphasized Serbia‚Äôs sovereignty in making decisions and expressed gratitude for Russia‚Äôs favorable gas supplies. Serbia is pursuing [EU membership](https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/enlargement-policy/serbia_en) but has avoided sanctions against Russia, citing national interests. Vucic acknowledged expected Western criticism but highlighted Serbia‚Äôs historical ties with Russia, marking the [80th anniversary](https://n1info.rs/english/news/belgrade-marks-80th-anniversary-of-liberation-vucic-lays-wreath-putin-sends-message/) of Belgrade‚Äôs liberation with pro-Russian sentiment.¬†

**üá¶üá± Albania:** The Special Prosecutors for Corruption arrested Albanian President Ilir Meta in Tirana on [charges of corruption](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/10/22/albanian-ex-president-ilir-meta-arrested-for-alleged-corruption), money laundering, and hiding assets. Footage showed police forcefully detaining Meta, leader of the [Freedom Party](https://tirana.embassy.qa/en/republic-of-albania/political-system), as he returned from Kosovo. Meta has been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Edi Rama, accusing him of authoritarianism. Meta‚Äôs lawyer and allies claim the arrest is politically motivated, with his party describing it as a ‚Äúcriminal kidnapping.‚Äù Meta denies the charges and asserts his innocence.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What makes Kosovo a divided subject?**

![Map of Kosovo highlighting its 2008 declaration of independence and global recognition status](/images/kosovo-map-U2OD.webp)

Kosovo is a landlocked region in the Balkans. It declared independence from Serbia in 2008, following decades of [ethnic tension](https://www.bbc.com/news/62382069) between its Albanian majority and Serbian minority and a violent conflict in the late 1990s. Serbia never recognized its independence, and the international community is divided. While over 100 countries, including the U.S. and most EU members, [recognize Kosovo](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/17/mapping-the-countries-that-recognise-kosovo-as-a-state-2) as a sovereign state, Serbia and many others, including Russia and China, do not.¬†

It‚Äôs a sensitive issue as both Serbs and ethnic Albanians have ethnic, historical, and cultural ties to the area. However,‚Äã‚Äã outside of Southeastern Europe, the biggest issue with Kosovo is the debate that came with it, which many call [‚Äúthe Kosovo Precedent.‚Äù](https://www.fletcherforum.org/home/2023/1/12/invoking-the-kosovo-precedent-can-we-dismiss-the-russian-argument) It refers to the debate about the implications of Kosovo‚Äôs independence from Serbia. Some countries argue that Kosovo‚Äôs secession could set a dangerous precedent for other separatist movements worldwide.¬†

While Kosovo's independence is often framed as an East vs. West issue, the reality is more nuanced. Russia‚Äôs cultural ties with Serbia and shared frustrations with NATO explain its opposition, but support for Kosovo crosses geopolitical lines. For example, countries like Libya, not aligned with the West, recognize Kosovo, as do many Muslim-majority nations due to cultural or religious ties. Some NATO members, like Spain and Slovakia, oppose Kosovo's independence, fearing it could embolden their own separatist movements. Similarly, large nations like China and India avoid recognition to prevent encouraging secessionist trends within their borders.¬†
