### Putin to visit Mongolia

Vladimir Putin plans to [visit Mongolia](https://www.politico.eu/article/vladimir-putin-russia-mongolia-icc-war-crimes-arrest-warrant/) today. This is his first visit to a country that is an ICC member. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for him over the transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia. The Ukrainian government has called for Mongolian authorities to arrest him. The Kremlin says there is no reason to cancel. The Mongolian parliament speaker did invite him. While officially, each ICC member is required to arrest someone if they are on their territory, it doesn’t seem that anything significant will likely happen. The International Criminal Court is based in The Hague. Currently, 124 countries are members, but Russia and the U.S. are not.

Mexican [students are protesting](https://www.dw.com/en/mexico-students-protest-planned-judicial-overhaul/a-70107162) the recent judicial reforms made by the president, who is scheduled to leave soon, but the incoming president also supports this decision. The judicial reform involves electing judges by popular vote instead of appointing them. This has made people worry that it could be abused and some less qualified judges can be elected. Supporters say it will do a better job in dealing with high crime. The US and Canada have expressed their distaste for this as well. It has put a strain on North American relations for the time being. Mexico’s legislative branch will vote on it this week.

### Israelis angered by hostage deaths

The recent news about the [six dead hostages](www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/1/israelis-protest-union-calls-strike-after-six-more-captives-killed-in-gaza) has put a bad taste in the mouths of many Israelis. There have been demonstrations all over Israel calling for a ceasefire-hostage deal. On Monday, it was revealed that the hostages suffered multiple gun wounds before being found. Israel’s largest trade union is currently also on strike. Sunday night, they had the largest anti-government protest since the start of the war almost 12 months ago. Roads were blocked in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The internal pressure within Israel is getting stronger. It’s becoming quite mainstream, even with those who lean more right.

### Drone strikes in Russia and Ukraine

Both Russia and Ukraine have undergone some [drone strikes](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/01/g-s1-20509/russia-downed-drones-in-ukrainian-attack). Russia claims it took down over 150 drones, including some over Moscow. Drone strikes from Ukraine have brought the fight far from the front line into the heart of Russia. It has made a lot of the Kremlin rethink a lot of warfare. It was not planned to even come within Russian Soil. Russia has conducted some drone strikes in Ukraine as well. Three people were killed and nine wounded on Sunday in Russian shelling in the town of Kurakhove, south of Pokrovsk, which is a city Russia has come close to taking in these last couple of weeks.

### German government frustrated by local elections in Eastern Germany

After two states' elections, the German government is puzzled and in a mini-crisis today. The far-right AfD did well in the state elections in Saxony and Thuringia. This is a complete disaster for the parties that comprise Germany's coalition government. While former East Germany tends to vote differently than the rest of Germany, this [raises some alarm](https://www.dw.com/en/populist-gains-in-state-elections-jolt-german-government/a-70106153) for the upcoming elections. Many wonder if this is a dress rehearsal for Germany’s next federal election. The stabbing last week did not help the current coalition-leading Germany. Another Eastern German state, Brandenburg, gets to vote in 3 weeks.
