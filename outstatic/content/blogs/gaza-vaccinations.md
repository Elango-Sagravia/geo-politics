### Populists win East German elections

Voters in East Germany [went to the polls](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-thuringia-and-saxony-elections-propel-far-right-afd/a-70106147) on Sunday. The German states of Thuringia and Saxony saw wins by both left—and right-wing populist parties. The far-right populist party came in first place in Thuringia by a significant amount. Also, the Sarha Wagehnkect party, which broke away from the mainstream left party, made huge gains while the traditional left party declined significantly. Last year, Wagenknecht abandoned the traditional left party and made a new one based on left-leaning economic policies, conservative views on migration, and pro-Russian foreign policy initiatives. The elections show there is still a significant difference between Eastern and Western Germany, nearly 35 years after reunification. It also shows a dissatisfaction with the current German establishment.

### Vaccinations underway in Gaza

UN agencies have rolled out [mass vaccinations](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gl62rvvp8o) to children under 10 in Gaza. This follows after contaminated water was shown to have traces of Polio, and an 11-month-old boy got his first case of polio in over 25 years. Both Israel and Hamas agreed to this pause for several days. While it is sort of a ceasefire and hostage deal, it is a step in the right direction. The return of Polio to Gaza is primarily thanks to the unsanitary conditions this almost 11-month war has caused. Many experts also fear the damage to infrastructure will delay the vaccines from getting everywhere they need to be.

### Serbia and France fighter jet deal

Last Thursday, France and Serbia signed a [3 billion Euro deal](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/29/serbia-and-france-sign-3bn-deal-for-sale-of-french-fighter-jets) to sell fighter jets. French President Emmanuel Macron came to Belgrade to facilitate the deal between the Serbian Defense Ministry and the French Aviation company Dassault. Serbian President Vucic was pleased with this deal. One of the main strategies for this is to bring Serbia closer to countries in the EU. Critics feel this is rewarding Serbia’s increasingly autocratic government. Serbia has been an EU candidate since 2012; however, it has grown even closer to Russia recently. They quit cooperating militarily with Russia in 2022 but have opposed other measures sanctioning Russia.

### Six hostages were found dead, including a US citizen

Israel’s military has confirmed that Hamas [killed six hostages](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/31/middleeast/israeli-american-hostage-hersh-goldberg-polin-death-intl-hnk/index.html), one of them including an Israeli American by the name of Hersh Goldberg-Polin. His family had been very vocal about pursuing a ceasefire/hostage deal. Three of the hostages found were supposed to have been released in a recent ceasefire deal. Israelis are becoming increasingly impatient with Netanyahu and his government for not coming up with a suitable deal to release the hostages and make a ceasefire. This might be bad news for the families of the hostages, but this could be the final straw for a lot of Israeli society, possibly the end of Netanyahu’s government.

### South China Sea update

China and the Philippines continue to push back and forth accusations of each party’s vessels for [intentionally colliding](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/31/asia/china-philippines-collision-south-china-sea-intl-latam/index.html) with each other in the South China Sea. Last Saturday, there was another incident related to this. Chinese and Philippine vessels have engaged in multiple collisions and face-offs over the past week near Sabina Shoal, a contested area of the South China Sea. The US State Department condemned China for this but also had several successful meetings in Beijing last week. The South China Sea is a geopolitical hot spot in Asia. China claims almost all of the South China Sea as its sovereign territory.
