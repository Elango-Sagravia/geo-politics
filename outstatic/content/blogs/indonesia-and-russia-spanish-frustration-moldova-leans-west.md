### Indonesia - Russia ties

![Indonesia and Russia conduct joint naval drills](/images/indonesia-and-russia-naval-drills-I5Mj.webp)

Indonesia‚Äôs [joint naval drills](https://www.dw.com/en/indonesia-and-russia-hold-first-joint-naval-exercises/a-70684385) with Russia mark a significant step under President [Prabowo Subianto](https://www.dw.com/en/indonesia-ex-general-prabowo-subianto-sworn-in-as-president/a-70544838), who seeks to deepen defense ties with Moscow while upholding Indonesia‚Äôs long-standing[ non-aligned foreign policy](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/06/29/indonesias-non-aligned-foreign-policy-limitation-or-opportunity/). Despite Western tensions over Russia‚Äôs actions in Ukraine, Prabowo‚Äôs administration is reviving trade and defense agreements, including a $1.1 billion fighter jet [deal](https://tass.com/economy/1129571), initially hindered by possible U.S. sanctions.

Analysts see engagement as a move to expand its geopolitical autonomy and maintain neutrality. There is also a solid economic motivation. Russia represents a valuable [market](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-country/rus/partner/idn) for Indonesia, the largest in Southeast Asia. The partnership enables Indonesia to diversify its international relationships across economic and defense arenas, reinforcing Prabowo‚Äôs commitment to an independent and multi-aligned strategy that ensures maximum flexibility in foreign policy.

### Flood of frustration

![Floods in eastern Spain spark public outrage and erode trust in government](/images/spanish-floods-bring-political-divide-and-distrust-gxMz.webp)

The recent floods in eastern Spain have sparked [widespread public outrage](https://www.politico.eu/article/spanish-flood-outrage-political-ruling-class-covid-climate-change-crisis/) and a significant decline in trust in government leadership. Residents in the areas most severely affected have vocally criticized government officials, accusing them of issuing insufficient warnings and demonstrating a slow response to the crisis.

The outrage has led to confrontations between these residents and figures such as Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez, who have faced tough questions about their handling of the situation. Public discontent is being compared to the widespread frustration and anger that followed the tragic [2004 Madrid train bombings](https://www.britannica.com/event/Madrid-train-bombings-of-2004), emphasizing the emotional and psychological impact such disasters have on the population. This raises concerns about governance and disaster management in the country.

### Moldova‚Äôs westward win

Pro-European Union leader [Maia Sandu](https://presedinte.md/eng/biography) has been [reelected](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-ukraine-congratulate-moldovan-president-maia-sandu/a-70679560) as Moldova‚Äôs president in a tight runoff amid accusations of [Russian interference](https://balkaninsight.com/2024/10/09/european-parliament-condemns-malicious-russian-interference-in-moldova/). Her win was welcomed by European and U.S. leaders, with German Chancellor Scholz, EU officials, and U.S. President Biden congratulating her for resisting Russian pressure. Neighboring Ukraine‚Äôs President Zelenskyy also celebrated the result.

Sandu‚Äôs victory signals continued commitment to EU alignment, especially significant in a region destabilized by the Ukraine war and regional authoritarian trends. [Moscow](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/11/05/kremlin-calls-moldovan-presidential-election-undemocratic-and-unfair-a86906) criticized the election as manipulated by Western influence. While Sadu will likely take Moldova on the path towards [EU recommendation](https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/european-neighbourhood-policy/countries-region/moldova_en), Moldova still has a long way to go. Because almost half the country still heavily gravitates towards Russia, the EU will be more reluctant to admit a country with a significant Russian leaning while dealing with current members with these learnings, such as Hungary.

**üáßüáº Botswana:** In a historic shift, Botswana‚Äôs longtime ruling party, the Botswana Democratic Party, [lost the presidency](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/1/botswanas-ruling-party-loses-power-after-six-decades-early-results-show) for the first time in nearly 60 years. President Mokgweetsi Masisi conceded to Duma Boko, leader of the opposition coalition Umbrella for Democratic Change, after a landslide victory. Boko‚Äôs win reflects public frustration with economic struggles and rising unemployment despite Botswana‚Äôs traditionally stable democracy. Masisi pledged a peaceful transition, while Boko promised to pursue economic reforms and improve social services.

**üáµüá∞ Pakistan:** A security guard in Karachi, Pakistan, [shot and injured](https://www.voanews.com/a/two-chinese-nationals-shot-and-injured-in-southern-pakistan-/7851845.html) two Chinese nationals following an argument, marking the third such attack against Chinese workers in Pakistan this year. One of the victims is in critical condition. This shooting reveals rising tensions between Pakistan and China over the security of Chinese nationals working on [Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative) projects, including the [China-Pakistan Economic Corridor](https://www.britannica.com/topic/China-Pakistan-Economic-Corridor). Recently, the Chinese ambassador expressed concerns over these security issues, prompting a rare, defensive response from Pakistan‚Äôs Foreign Ministry.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is a swing state?**

![Swing states like Georgia, Arizona, and Pennsylvania play a crucial role in deciding U.S. presidential elections](/images/swing-states-M2Nz.webp)

A ‚Äúswing state‚Äù is a U.S. state where no single political party consistently dominates in presidential elections, making it highly competitive. These states can ‚Äúswing‚Äù toward either the Democratic or Republican candidate, and their outcomes are often unpredictable. Because they are not firmly aligned with one party, swing states play a crucial role in deciding the overall election, as winning these states can provide a significant number of Electoral College votes [(see write-up)](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/biden-supports-taiwan-hezbollah-vows-to-fight). Candidates often focus campaign efforts on swing states to secure a victory.

Swing states have changed throughout history due to shifts in demographics. [Florida](https://eu.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/04/florida-general-election-day-swing-state/76041796007/) was a major swing state, but now it is mainly red. Virginia used to lean right to be one, but now it leans more blue and was a swing state in the past. The most recent swing states for the 2024 US presidential election were Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Many find the situation with the Electoral College frustrating as less than ten states decide the Presidential elections.
