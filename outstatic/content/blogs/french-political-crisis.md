### Macron rejects proposed left-wing government

French President Emmanual Macron continues to [alienate](https://www.dw.com/en/anger-after-macron-rejects-france-left-wing-government/a-70055758) members of France’s new left-wing block, the new popular front. He rejected their proposed government. The left-wing alliance consists of various left parties. This group got the most seats in the country's parliamentary election earlier this summer. Macron says this group leading the government would lead to institutional stability. While Macron’s centrist group struggles with the far-right group led by Marine Le Pen, it doesn’t seem to make many friends on the left wing either. Another issue in the background is some friction among some parties within the alliance. The Unbowed Movement is not always popular with left parties who find it extreme.

### Japan and China airspace drama

Japan [reprimanded](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gv4zede8jo) China this week on account of one of their military jets breaking into Japanese airspace for two minutes on Monday. Japan issued a statement saying this violation is unacceptable. An official from the Chinese embassy has been summoned. Both countries have been in a lengthy dispute over the Senkaku Islands. While China has not been as significant a problem aside from the subject involving the Senkaku Islands, Japan is more politically aligned with countries like South Korea and the US. This is also not the first time China has caused friction with other Asian nations. It is currently in a riff with the Philippines over some parts of the South China Sea.

A jihadi armed[ group ](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/26/nearly-200-people-dead-whats-behind-armed-attacks-in-burkina-faso)in Burkina Faso killed almost 200 people last weekend in the town of Basrshalogho, which is in the center of the country. It is right by the town of Kaya, which is a central strategic point for the Jihadi group called JNIM. This is where the last government military force stands in the way of  JNIM. JNIM  is one of several armed operating in Burkina Faso whose goal is to establish an Islamic caliphate and expel Western-influenced governments. The country has lost control of half of the country. Burkina Faso is not the only country affected by this group. They have spread to other countries in West Africa.

The [Taliban ](https://apnews.com/article/taliban-afghanistan-women-vice-virtue-law-8be7e4ebbe8012a1290f6d5292f781e3)released some new laws for women in the last week. The laws forbid women from showing their faces in public. They are also now forbidden to sing or speak in public places. The UN and many human rights groups around the world have criticized this. The leading spokesman for the Taliban warns against “arrogance” from those who he said may not be familiar with Islamic law, despite the many objections from many Muslims. This month also marks three years of the Taliban takeover. It has put a lot of debates in the IR world on whether countries should try to make relations with the Taliban. This issue makes it more difficult, even for the countries that already did.

### The Lebanon-Israel conflict is settling a bit

Israeli and Hezbollah have[ cooled ](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gv4zede8jo)down a bit from last weekend. Hezbollah and Israeli forces exchanged some missiles and drone attacks on Sunday. Luckily, casualties and primary targets were, for the most part, avoided. Since October 7th, Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire. Hezbollah is an ally of Hamas and has said it is giving solidarity with the people of Gaza. However, the actual Lebanese government seems to want to avoid a full-on war with Israel. Both sides say that this is not the end. As long as Israel has its war in Haza and Iran backs proxy groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, the Middle East will continue to remain unstable.
