![President Biden and Vice President Harris spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu](/images/biden-and-netanyahu-speak-for-first-time-in-weeks-as-israeli-attack-on-iran-looms-U0NT.webp)

President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday in their first conversation in two months. The call, lasting about 30 minutes, followed [Iran’s ballistic missile attack](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-iran-us-warns-ballistic-missile-attack-amid-idf-ground-operations-lebanon-hezbollah/), with Israel preparing its retaliation. The White House described the conversation as “direct” and “productive.”Biden and Harris affirmed [Israel’s right to defend itself](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harris-trump-iran-israel-gaza-positions/) but expressed concerns about further escalation in the Middle East. Biden opposed an Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, though discussions continue regarding Israel’s potential military actions.

Meanwhile, Israel continued its [operations in southern Lebanon](https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-expand-invasion-south-lebanon/), targeting Hezbollah strongholds and expanding its ground forces. Cross-border hostilities have intensified, and Hezbollah launched numerous projectiles into Israel. In Gaza, the [death toll](https://efe.com/en/latest-news/2024-10-09/gaza-death-toll-exceeds-42000-after-a-year-of-conflict/) reached over 42,000 as Israel expanded its offensive, with thousands of Palestinians displaced.

### Taiwan Celebrates National Day 

Taiwan celebrated its [National Day](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/10/taiwan-celebrates-national-day-holiday-against-background-of-chinese-threats-00183192) on Thursday, honoring the 1911 founding of the Republic of China and its subsequent retreat to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War. The day’s festivities took place against a backdrop of heightened tensions with China, which claims Taiwan as its territory.

President Lai Ching-te emphasized [unity and stability in Taiwan](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2024/10/10/2003825065), urging citizens to work together for national prosperity.  Lai advocated for cross-political cooperation with opposition parties to foster national unity. 

A recent survey shows that over two-thirds of Taiwanese people are [willing to defend their island](https://www.dw.com/en/most-taiwanese-would-defend-island-against-china-poll-finds/a-70440750) against a potential Chinese invasion. Conducted by the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, the poll reveals that 67.8% of respondents would be “very willing or somewhat willing” to fight if attacked, while 23.6% would not. Nearly 64% view China’s territorial ambitions as a “serious threat,” yet 61% believe an invasion is unlikely soon. 

### Afghan National Arrested for Plotting Election Day Attack

An Afghan national was arrested in Oklahoma for allegedly [planning an Election Day attack](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/afghan-national-arrested-plotting-election-day-terrorist-attack-name-isis), the U.S. Department of Justice announced. The 27-year-old, identified as Nasir A. T., reportedly intended to carry out a violent attack on U.S. soil in support of the [Islamic State (IS)](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Islamic-State-in-Iraq-and-the-Levant). He allegedly obtained firearms and ammunition to target large gatherings of people, planning to die as a martyr alongside a minor co-conspirator, who is also Afghan, and his brother-in-law.

Authorities apprehended A. T. while purchasing two AK-47 rifles from an undercover FBI official. He had entered the U.S. in 2021 through the Special Immigrant Visa Program. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security highlighted the ongoing threat of lone offenders and small groups inspired by extremist organizations.

### Orban Sparks Divisions at the European Parliament

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s [presentation of his priorities](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/10/09/viktor-orban-splits-the-european-parliament-with-presidential-speech) for Hungary’s upcoming EU Presidency sparked deep division within the European Parliament, with both applause and boos greeting his speech. Orbán’s approach received strong criticism from left-wing MEPs and centrist groups, while right-wing factions praised his stance on migration and traditional family values. Critics labeled Orban an “autocrat,” accusing him of undermining democracy and cozying up to authoritarian leaders like Putin and Xi Jinping.

On the right, Orban found support for his hardline positions on [migration](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/06/we-never-let-them-in-hungarys-pm-viktor-orban-demands-new-laws-tackling-migration) and energy policy. Italian MEP Paolo Borchia commended his focus on European border protection and economic competitiveness. However, some were not sold on his soft stance on Russia, particularly his call for dialogue with Moscow. The reaction to Orban’s presentation shows that the growing political polarization in the European Union is becoming on par with the United States.

### France to Host Lebanon Conference Later This Month

Speaking at the end of a Francophonie summit, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that the 88 member countries of the International Organisation of La Francophonie ([OIF](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Organisation-Internationale-de-la-Francophonie)) unanimously called for an [“immediate and lasting” ceasefire in Lebanon](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/10/06/lebanon-macron-says-88-francophone-countries-call-for-immediate-ceasefire_6728331_4.html). This call comes in response to the escalating violence in the region, particularly following[ Israel’s retaliatory operations](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/10/10/live-israel-kills-medics-in-lebanon-as-siege-on-north-gaza-enters-6th-day) in Gaza and neighboring Lebanon. Macron mentioned that France would host an international conference in October to support Lebanon.

Macron expressed regret over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to proceed with ground operations in Lebanon but reiterated Israel’s right to self-defense. The broader regional crisis, sparked by Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7, has resulted in heavy casualties on both sides. The tense situation in Lebanon has made French leadership rethink some aspects of its relationship with Israel due to the [historical and cultural ties](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israels-war-lebanon-can-france-stop-bloodshed) France has with Lebanon.

### FOUNDATIONS 

**What is the One China policy?**

![One China Policy asserts Taiwan is part of China](/images/_taiwan-related-topic-M5OD.webp)

The [One China Policy](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-us-one-china-policy-and-why-does-it-matter) is a diplomatic principle that recognizes only one China and asserts that Taiwan is a part of it. This means that countries can only establish formal relations with the People’s Republic of China (mainland China) or Taiwan (officially the Republic of China), but not both. Currently, thirteen countries maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Despite not formally recognizing Taiwan as a separate nation, many countries, including major powers like the U.S., engage in informal relations, such as trade and cultural exchanges.

The policy has significant implications for travel between mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. Although mainland China considers these regions part of a single entity, travel between them is treated as international. As a result, travelers may encounter different visa requirements. For example, U.S. passport holders require a visa to enter China, while no visa is necessary for tourists in Taiwan.
