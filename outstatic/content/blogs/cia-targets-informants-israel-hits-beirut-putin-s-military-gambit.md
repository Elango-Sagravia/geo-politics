### CIA Seeks Informants in Iran, China, and North Korea 

![CIA Seeks Informants in Iran, China, and North Korea](/images/cia-seeks-informants-in-iran--china--and-north-korea-kwOD.webp)

The CIA has launched a new [recruitment drive](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyvng0jw78o) targeting informants in China, Iran, and North Korea. The agency posted messages on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and Telegram with instructions in Mandarin, Farsi, and Korean on how to contact them securely using encrypted VPNs and the Tor browser. This campaign follows a similar successful effort targeting [Russian informants](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/cia-posts-video-asking-russians-share-secrets-us-spies-rcna84595) last year.

While North Korea’s internet access is limited, experts believe the CIA may be targeting cross-border traders who enter China. However, the risks remain high, as informants in these authoritarian states face severe consequences, including imprisonment or execution if caught. This recruitment effort also signals an adjustment by the CIA to deal with the increasing global surveillance from adversaries like China and Iran. Still, questions remain about the actual value of the intelligence that can be gathered.

### Israel Strikes Beirut

Israel launched airstrikes on Hezbollah’s intelligence headquarters in southern Beirut on Thursday, following a deadly strike earlier in central Beirut that killed nine people. This [escalation](https://www.dw.com/en/israel-hits-central-beirut-as-who-says-hospitals-overwhelmed/live-70392173) marks the first strike on central Beirut since the [2006 conflict](https://www.britannica.com/event/2006-Lebanon-War), as Israel continues expanding its ground operations in southern Lebanon. Over 1,000 people have died, and about 1 million have been displaced since the Israel-Hezbollah conflict flared up.

Lebanon’s foreign minister revealed that Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah had [agreed to a ceasefire](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/03/middleeast/lebanon-hezbollah-nasrallah-ceasefire-assassination-intl-latam/index.html) just before his assassination by Israel. Meanwhile, Israel is now planning its response to a missile strike from Iran, with U.S. President Biden expressing opposition to strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites but leaving the option open for targeting its oil reserves.

### UK to Return the Last African Colony to Mauritius

The UK has agreed to [return](https://www.euronews.com/2024/10/03/uk-to-return-its-last-african-colony-to-mauritius-ending-years-of-dispute) the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, ending a long-standing dispute over the former British territory. However, the strategic island of Diego Garcia, home to a vital UK-US military base, will remain under their control for the next 99 years. This deal, announced after years of negotiations, addresses past wrongs, including the forced eviction of around 1,500 residents in the 1970s. While those evicted may now return to other islands, Diego Garcia is excluded. 

The base remains crucial for US military operations in the Middle East, South Asia, and East Africa. Giving back this colony symbolizes an end to the expression “ the sun never sets on the British empire.” The geographical placement of the Chacago islands means that after the spring equinox of 2025, the sun will set on the British Empire in March 2025. Britain still has overseas territories, similar to France and the Netherlands. They aren’t legally colonies but formally known as overseas territories and function similarly to colonies. 

### Putin Allows Criminals to Join the Military to Avoid Trial

Russian President Vladimir Putin passed a [new law](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-military-russia-criminals-putin-f96f38b07ddd20dcd9c71586be205e18) that allows people facing criminal charges to avoid prosecution by joining the military. The law applies to those under investigation and ones already on trial. If they join up and later leave the military due to age and health issues, or if martial law ends, their charges could be dropped altogether. 

With the war in Ukraine dragging on, Russia’s been looking for ways to boost its military numbers. Putin recently called for an increase of 180,000 troops, and the government’s budget now devotes a record 32.5% to military spending. [(see previous issue)](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/biden-supports-taiwan-hezbollah-vows-to-fight) This law seems to be another way to fill those ranks.

### Chinese Coast Guard Claims To Have Entered the Arctic Ocean 

China’s Coast Guard recently claimed to have [entered Arctic waters](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/03/china/china-russia-coast-guard-arctic-ocean-intl-hnk/index.html) for the first time, partnering with Russia on a joint patrol. This development signals China’s growing interest in the Arctic, which it aims to influence despite not being a country in the [Arctic Council](https://arctic-council.org/). The U.S. Coast Guard [observed](https://www.news.uscg.mil/Press-Releases/Article/3922625/us-coast-guard-encounters-joint-chinese-coast-guard-russian-border-guard-patrol/) four Russian and Chinese vessels in the Bering Sea, making this the furthest north a Chinese ship has gone. 

This patrol extends China’s maritime reach, traditionally dominated by the U.S. Beijing, aligning with Russia, is pursuing Arctic ambitions like the [“Polar Silk Road,”](https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/china-polar-silk-road-long-game-failed-strategy/) motivated by potential shipping routes and strategic interests amid increased geopolitical tension with the U.S. This also raises concern for other countries within the Arctic Council, who all happen to be NATO members, aside from Russia. 

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is the Levant, and how did it become?**

![Map of the Levant region, spanning modern-day Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and parts of Syria and Turkey](/images/what-is-the-levant--and-how-did-it-come-to-be--Y4NT.webp)

Sitting along the Eastern Mediterranean, the [Levant](https://www.britannica.com/place/Levant) has always been a meeting point for cultures and civilizations. Stretching across what we now know as Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and parts of Syria and Turkey, it’s been a crossroads for thousands of years because of its location between Europe, Asia, and Africa. The name “Levant” comes from the French word for “rising,” a nod to the east where the sun rises.

In ancient times, the Canaanites and Phoenicians thrived here, with the Phoenicians leaving a lasting legacy through their navigational skills and the creation of one of the first alphabets. Over the centuries, empires like the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Persians fought to control the region. Then came the Greeks and Romans, and later the rise of Islam, which turned the Levant into a central hub of trade and culture under the Umayyads and Abbasids. 

The Levant’s history has always been layered and complex, from the Crusades to Ottoman rule. It remains a vibrant region, with its rich past still influencing its cultures and politics. This present day comes with no shortage of these complexities.
