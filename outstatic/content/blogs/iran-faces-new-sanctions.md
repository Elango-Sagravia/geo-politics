### US, UK, France and Germany Announce Sanctions on Iran

The United States, Britain, France, and Germany announced on Tuesday that Iran had given Russia [ballistic missiles](https://www.dw.com/en/ballistic-missiles-to-russia-us-europe-sanction-iran/a-70181326) for use in Ukraine. Iran will be handed some new sanctions very shortly. The finer details of the sanctions have not yet been revealed. The new Iranian president has said he wants to collectively build better relations with the EU, so this allegation doesn’t help in this sense.

Iran has denounced this and said this wasn’t true. They said it is an excuse for the US to cover up illegal weapons being sent to Israel. Most of their reply surrounded Gaza and how the US and EU have been supplying Israel with weapons more than trying to give evidence to the contrary. Russia did not comment on the allegation but said Iran and Russia have been cooperating on sensitive issues. Ukraine did intercept a lot of drones from Russia that were initially Iranian.

In addition, this discovery might allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles. Currently, the UK and US have not permitted them to use long-range missiles against targets inside Russia. Ukraine has been looking for reasons to use these, and this might be what allows them to do this.

### Ukrainian Drones Affecting Moscow More Heavily

Ukraine had its most significant drone attack so far in Moscow this week, killing at least one and sabotaging dozens of homes, and [forcing flights](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-destroys-ukraine-launched-drone-flying-towards-moscow-mayor-says-2024-09-09/) to be diverted from airports around Moscow. Ukraine has been seeing more victories from within Russia. It’s launching drone strikes in the capital and has taken a significant piece of territory around Kursk.

However, it hasn’t come without its struggles. Russia has also sent a fair number of drone attacks in Ukraine. Russian drones and missiles have gone into Western Ukraine in the last week and even had some drones go out of bounds in NATO territory. Russia is getting close to taking Pokrovsk's key city in Eastern Ukraine. It took four more villages at the beginning of this week.

### Philippines and Vietnam Renew Ties

In the last few weeks, the Philippines and Vietnam have agreed to boost their defense links and collaborate more closely on [maritime security](https://www.dw.com/en/south-china-sea-philippines-vietnam-deepen-defense-ties/a-70181293). Both countries' respective defense ministers have been meeting and discussing plans. An official agreement is to be made at the end of the year. Both countries have ongoing issues with China regarding the South China Sea.

This is a crucial development as both countries are from competing spheres of influence. The Philippines is more allied with the US, while Vietnam is more ideologically allied with China. However, both countries are members of ASEAN, a customs union with Southeast Asian nations. China’s disputes in the South China Sea are helping Southeast Asia band closer in their common interests.

### 21 Die in Airstrike in Sudan

Earlier this week, an airstrike went down on a civilian marketplace in Southern Sudan and killed 21 people. This is one of the recent casualties of the [civil war](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/09/africa/sudan-airstrike-market-intl/index.html) that has been taking place between Sudan’s national army and the paramilitary. The paramilitary is known as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The civil war has been ravaging Sudan since the spring of 2023.

While this is a civil war and looks to be an “ internal issue,” that isn’t necessarily the whole truth. Both sides have backing from different entities. Egypt and Iran support the national army, while the UAE supports the RSF. However, it is not quite a proxy war, as other usual suspects aren’t involved.

### Spanish PM Meets With Chinese President

Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez this week to discuss the ongoing EU-Chinese issues, particularly [trade disputes](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/spanish-autos-pork-beijings-sights-with-pm-sanchez-china-2024-09-09/). Xi Jinping asked Sanchez to help build EU ties. They also discussed the dispute over the 36.3% tax the European Union wants on imported Chinese vehicles. Sanchez says he hopes the EU can avoid a trade war with China.

The EU and China have been at a low point collectively regarding International Relations. Although each EU member state has a relationship with China, some are better than others. China’s position on the Ukraine-Russia war has also been a sore subject for many EU members, much more than general trade issues.
