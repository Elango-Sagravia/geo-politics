### 35 years after Berlin Wall fall

On Friday, Berlin [commemorated](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-commemorates-35-years-since-fall-of-berlin-wall/a-70743233) the 35th anniversary of the [Berlin Wall](https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/what-was-the-berlin-wall-and-how-did-it-fall)‚Äôs fall with ceremonies and public art honoring the pursuit of freedom. Thousands gathered at the Berlin Wall Memorial, where German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Economy Minister Robert Habeck laid flowers at the remaining wall section. The celebration also included concert series featuring East German rock and performances from international artists, with Russian protest band [Pussy Riot](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2hThsqaVEAWhWPBXnaOfB9) set to perform on Sunday.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz praised the historic moment in a video message, calling the Wall‚Äôs fall a victory for Europe, achieved through courage and solidarity. He stressed that these qualities are still needed today. Although many believe that there are still some [stark differences](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/07/east-germany-west-far-right-afd-gdr) between the West and Eastern parts of the country, this was seen a couple of months ago with regional [elections](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/germanys-east-faces-populist-big-bang-at-regional-elections/) in the former East.

### Qatar halts Gaza talks

!["Qatar halts Israel-Hamas ceasefire mediation and closes Hamas' Doha office](/images/qatar-suspends-its-gaza-cease-fire-g3OT.webp)

Qatar has [halted](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/09/politics/qatar-gaza-ceasefire-pause-mediator/index.html) its mediation efforts for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas due to stalled negotiations and the lack of hostage releases. Following this, Qatari officials closed Hamas' political office in Doha. Although U.S. officials had [urged Qatar](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/21/politics/blinken-qatar-hamas-gaza-negotiations/index.html) to leverage its influence over Hamas, the closure was ultimately Qatar's decision, aligning with U.S. interests.

Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari criticized recent media coverage as ‚Äúinaccurate,‚Äù stating that the suspension of the Hamas office does not prevent its reopening if genuine negotiations with Israel occur. This follows a similar action in April when Qatar closed the office and moved officials to Turkey but was asked by the U.S. and Israel to return once talks resumed, emphasizing [Qatar's role](https://time.com/7022826/qatar-diplomacy-history/) in Middle Eastern diplomacy.

### Cop 29 in Baku

The COP29 [climate summit in Baku](https://theconversation.com/the-cop29-climate-talks-are-about-to-kick-off-in-baku-azerbaijan-heres-what-to-expect-242706) will concentrate on improving climate finance for vulnerable nations, addressing adaptation funding gaps, and updating carbon market rules. Dubbed the "finance COP," the talks aim to hold wealthier countries accountable for their funding commitments and to promote private sector involvement in climate investments. Amid global challenges, including concerns about U.S. climate commitments due to Donald Trump‚Äôs potential re-election and geopolitical tensions, significant climate actions and new emissions targets are expected from critical nations.

However, Azerbaijan is facing [criticism](https://www.rferl.org/a/cop29-azerbaijan-rights-problem-climate/33183450.html) for hosting COP29, with accusations of "greenwashing" its reputation amid ongoing environmental and human rights issues. Reports from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and outlets like the Financial Times and The Economist have pointed out Azerbaijan's authoritarian governance and minimal climate commitments. The proposed ["COP Truce‚Äù](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/17/azerbaijan-accused-of-hypocrisy-after-calling-for-cop29-global-truce) has also raised doubts, especially following recent military actions in [Nagorno-Karabakh](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18270325), complicating Azerbaijan‚Äôs role as host of the summit.

**üá∫üá≤ USA:** After Trump's recent election win, Elon Musk joined [a call](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/08/europe/ukraine-trump-elon-musk-zelensky-intl-latam/index.html) between U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the brief call, Zelensky thanked Musk for [Starlink‚Äôs role](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/25/europe/ukraine-starlink-drones-russia-intl-cmd/index.html) in Ukraine‚Äôs communications amid its conflict with Russia. While no policy topics were discussed, Musk‚Äôs presence has prompted concerns about his influence in the incoming administration, particularly given his prior [interactions with Russian](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/25/politics/elon-musk-vladimir-putin/index.html) officials and [Trump‚Äôs campaign](https://www.presidentialsummary.com/archives/on-the-road-to-scotland-the-musk-effect-and-social-media-ban) and his company‚Äôs extensive ties with [U.S. federal contracts](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/14/investing/elon-musk-wealth-taxpayer-support/index.html).

**üáæüá™ Yemen:** The recent U.S. and U.K. [airstrikes in Yemen](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/10/uk-us-carry-out-strikes-on-yemen-including-sanaa) targeted advanced weapon storage sites, reportedly used by [Houthi rebels](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67614911) to launch attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Al Masirah TV, a Houthi-run channel, reported overnight explosions in Sanaa and surrounding areas, with no immediate casualty updates. This escalation comes amid rising Houthi attacks on shipping lanes and missile strikes against Israeli targets, partly in response to the ongoing [Israel-Gaza conflict](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-44124396). The situation underscores broader regional instability, complicating efforts to maintain Yemen‚Äôs fragile truce established in 2022.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is an observer state?**

![Observer state status allows entities like Palestine and the Holy See](/images/observer-status-Q3Mz.webp)

An observer state is a non-member entity granted a specific status within an international organization. This status allows the state to engage in various activities and discussions without full voting rights. Observer states play a crucial role in dialogue and decision-making by participating in meetings, contributing to debates, and sharing their perspectives on significant issues.¬†

A significant example of this arrangement can be found within the [United Nations](https://www.ungeneva.org/en/blue-book/missions/non-member-states) (UN), where certain entities such as Palestine and the Holy See (Vatican City) hold observer status. This allows them to engage with member states on matters of global significance and to express their viewpoints, even though they cannot influence the outcomes through voting.¬†
