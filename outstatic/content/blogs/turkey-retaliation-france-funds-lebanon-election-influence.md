A recent [attack](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/23/europe/turkey-ankara-aerospace-attack-intl/index.html) targeted Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) near Ankara, leaving five dead and injuring 22. Turkish officials suspect the [Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20971100) in this assault, although no group has claimed responsibility. The attackers, a man and a woman, died in the incident, which sparked both local and international condemnation. In response, Turkey launched [retaliatory airstrikes](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/24/turkey-strikes-iraq-syria-after-attack-on-defence-company-near-ankara) against PKK targets in northern Iraq and Syria.

This incident has brought renewed attention to Turkey‚Äôs policies toward Kurdish groups in the region, with particular sensitivity to groups like the [Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)](https://ecfr.eu/special/mena-armed-groups/syrian-democratic-forces-syria/), which Turkey views as connected to the PKK, a designated terrorist organization in Turkey and the U.S.

### France to Lebanon

At a Paris conference, international partners pledged [$1 billion in aid](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241024-key-figures-absent-as-france-hosts-lebanon-aid-conference-in-paris) to Lebanon. The pledge includes $800 million for humanitarian assistance to aid displaced and vulnerable populations affected by regional conflicts, especially amid escalating violence between Hezbollah and Israel. Another $200 million is set aside to strengthen Lebanon‚Äôs armed forces, especially for security needs in southern Lebanon.

The [ongoing conflict in Lebanon](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgx3zjvjg3o) has caused widespread family displacement and impacted the country's fragile economy. French President Emmanuel Macron highlighted the need for significant aid to assist the Lebanese people during this crisis. The conference also discussed plans to strengthen Lebanon's military resources, particularly for potential deployments in the southern region.

### Election Influence

According to Microsoft, it appears that Iranian hackers are preparing to launch a significant [influence operation](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/23/influence-iran-china-russia-elections-microsoft-00185075) leading up to the U.S. elections. This effort aligns with similar activities observed in China and Russia. The Iranian group, known as Cotton Sandstorm, is expected to focus on election-related websites, utilizing strategies that proved effective during the 2020 election cycle.¬†

In addition, China‚Äôs initiative, referred to as ‚ÄúSpamouflage,‚Äù and Russia‚Äôs group, [Storm-1516,](https://incidentdatabase.ai/entities/storm-1516/) are reportedly actively spreading disinformation and content designed to create division among U.S. politicians and the electorate. In light of these developments, cybersecurity experts and government officials stress the importance of media literacy skills among citizens, organizations, and authorities. [Election interference](https://www.ebsco.com/sites/default/files/acquiadam-assets/Points-of-View-Reference-Center-Election-Interference-Overview.pdf) is a global problem that expands beyond the US borders.

Speaking on the anniversary of the Hungarian uprising against Soviet rule, Orb√°n urged citizens to resist EU influence, criticizing Brussels and Ukraine‚Äôs President Zelenskyy for seeking to extend the war in Ukraine. Orb√°n faces increasing political pressure as opposition leader Peter Magy√°r of the [Tisza party gains support](https://tvpworld.com/83125481/hungarian-main-opposition-party-surpasses-pm-orbans-fidesz-in-second-poll), overtaking Orb√°n‚Äôs Fidesz in the polls for the first time since 2010.

A draft communique suggests a push for further research and discussions on reparatory justice, including financial reparations and other acknowledgment forms. Caribbean nations are particularly vocal, pressing the UK for an apology and reparations. The UK government maintains that reparations are not on the summit‚Äôs agenda and prefers focusing on current challenges like climate change.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What are the three Guyanas?**

![Map of the Guiana region, highlighting Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana](/images/3-guyanas-Y4MD.webp)

The region of Guiana, located in northeastern South America, historically referred to the broader area encompassing present-day Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and parts of Venezuela and Brazil. Each area was differentiated by the European country that colonized it, leading to names like British Guiana (now Guyana), Dutch Guiana (now Suriname), and French Guiana (still a French overseas department).

[Guyana](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-19546909) is an independent country known for its pristine rainforests, which host diverse wildlife, including exotic birds and unique plants.¬†

[Suriname](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/suriname/), also known as "Dutch Guiana," is the smallest country in South America. The capital, [Paramaribo](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/940/), is a UNESCO World Heritage site recognized for its colonial architecture and vibrant communities.

[French Guiana](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-20376142) is an overseas region of France and part of the EU. It is home to the Guiana Space Centre, a major spaceport for significant missions.¬†

This regional name of Guiana was used in colonial times due to shared geographical and cultural aspects, but after Suriname gained independence from the Netherlands in 1975, the name ‚ÄúDutch Guiana‚Äù fell out of formal use, solidifying Suriname as its official name.
