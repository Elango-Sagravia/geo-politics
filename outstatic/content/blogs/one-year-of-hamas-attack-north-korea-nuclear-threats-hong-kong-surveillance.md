### One Year of Conflict in the Middle East

![One Year of Conflict in the Middle East](/images/1-year-since-the-incident-in-israel-and-it-s-been-a-year-of-war-in-gaza--1--Q0Nz.webp)

Today marks one year since Hamas launched the attack on Israel, which resulted in over a thousand deaths and hundreds of kidnappings. Since then, tens of thousands have died in the [ongoing conflict](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/oct-7-tens-thousands-dead-forever-war-rcna166765), and over a hundred hostages remain unreturned. Hopes for peace have significantly diminished; Israel remains angered and shaken, with families of hostages suffering deeply, while Gaza faces a humanitarian disaster due to intense bombing.

The situation in the Middle East [continues to escalate](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5142440/israeli-gaza-lebanon-oct-7), with increased attacks between Israel and Iranian-backed proxy groups. Countries like Egypt and [Jordan](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4603890-why-jordan-came-to-israels-rescue/), which have formal relationships with Israel, are facing growing discontent among their populations, making peace efforts increasingly difficult. Neither of these nations nor any of Israel’s Western allies have successfully developed a viable peace plan. These conflicts have led to significant political polarization in the West, with a notable rise in [antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents](https://www.voanews.com/a/antisemitism-islamophobia-surge-in-2023-watchdogs-say/7407451.html).

### Kim Jong-Un Threatens South Korea

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has [issued a warning](https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-nuclear-weapons-south-b10f3ee96e9a1171ad8043f2d8d0f8bb), threatening to deploy nuclear weapons against South Korea if provoked. This follows remarks by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who stated that any nuclear aggression from the North would result in the regime’s collapse. Heightened tensions have emerged due to North Korea’s recent [missile tests](https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-kim-missiles-39ac9c4a37ebc7c827651e4256add05b) and the unveiling of a new nuclear facility.

Kim criticized Yoon’s military posture as indicative of an understanding deficit. The ongoing animosities reflect a long-standing [cycle of provocation](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/19/asia/north-korea-south-korea-intl-hnk/index.html) and response, intensifying since diplomatic channels stalled in 2019. This development raises concerns over the stability of the Korean Peninsula and the potential for military conflict.

### Macron Criticizes Netanyahu

French President Emmanuel Macron has called for a halt to arms deliveries to Israel for use in Gaza, emphasizing the need for a political solution and expressing concern over escalating violence. [This statement](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr3zd4d8y5o) drew sharp criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who labeled the call for an arms embargo a “disgrace.” He asserted that Israel would prevail regardless of external support. 

Macron, while reaffirming France’s commitment to Israel’s security, [criticized](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cje3zl0dq2ko) Israel’s military actions in Lebanon. Western leadership, in general, is becoming disenfranchised by Netanyahu. US President [Biden said](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cje3zl0dq2ko) he wasn’t sure if Netanyahu is holding off on agreeing to a Gaza ceasefire to influence the election.

### Hong Kong to Use Chinese Style of Surveillance

Hong Kong is ramping up its surveillance efforts, planning to [install thousands of new cameras](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/05/asia/hong-kong-police-cameras-facial-recognition-intl-hnk-dst/index.html), potentially equipped with facial recognition and AI capabilities. While authorities claim these measures are necessary to combat crime, experts warn this could lead to a surveillance state similar to [mainland China](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/19/china/hong-kong-second-national-security-law-passed-intl-hnk/index.html), especially given the political climate following the 2019 protests and subsequent national security laws. 

With increasing concerns about privacy and human rights, critics call for stronger regulations to protect citizens. While Hong Kong’s governance structure differs from Taiwan’s, the similarities in Beijing’s approach to Hong Kong’s autonomy have raised alarms in the international community about the future of democratic freedoms in the region​.

### Russia Escalates Attacks on Odesa and Kyiv

The Ukrainian military successfully shot down 56 out of at least 87 [drones launched by Russia ](https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-launches-attacks-on-kyiv-and-odesa-ukraine-says/)in a significant drone assault targeting Kyiv and Odesa. The attack resulted in air-raid alerts across much of Ukraine, causing damage to critical infrastructure, including warehouses and cargo trucks in Odesa. In the Kherson region, one civilian was reported dead, and 15 others were injured in the past 24 hours due to ongoing strikes. 

This escalation follows the downing of a Russian fighter aircraft in the Donetsk region, signaling a continued intensification of hostilities between the two nations. While recent conflicts in the Middle East have garnered significant attention, the war in Ukraine remains a pressing issue. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is still awaiting permission to deploy [long-range weapons](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-domestic-ballistic-missile-production-russia-volodymyr-zelensky-1963039) promised by Western allies, which could potentially change the dynamics of the ongoing conflict. The situation continues to evolve as both sides brace for further confrontations.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is the World Heritage Convention?**

![World Heritage Convention](/images/what-is-the-world-heritage-convention---1--kwMT.webp)

The World Heritage Convention, adopted by UNESCO in 1972, aims to preserve cultural and natural heritage sites of outstanding universal value. This landmark treaty emphasizes the importance of safeguarding such sites for future generations and fosters international cooperation in heritage conservation. The convention encourages member states to identify and nominate sites for inclusion on the World Heritage List, which currently features over [1,100 properties worldwide](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/).

By designating these sites, the convention promotes awareness, sustainable tourism, and local economic development while ensuring that conservation efforts are supported by international funding and expertise. Furthermore, it emphasizes the significance of traditional practices and community involvement in preserving cultural heritage. The World Heritage Convention recognizes the intrinsic value of these sites and highlights humanity's shared responsibility to protect our collective heritage. Through its ongoing efforts, the convention is crucial in promoting cultural understanding and fostering peace among nations.
