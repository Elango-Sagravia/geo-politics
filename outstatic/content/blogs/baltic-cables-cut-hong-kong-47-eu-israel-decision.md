### Cables cut

![Disrupted undersea internet cables in the Baltic Sea, raising concerns of sabotage amid rising Russian tensions](/images/undersea-data-cable-between-germany-and-finland-broken-czNT.webp)

Two critical [undersea internet cables](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/18/europe/undersea-cable-disrupted-germany-finland-intl/index.html) in the [Baltic Sea](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Baltic+Sea/@57.156325,14.4545998,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x46f4d7d988201b2b:0xb43097ae8474cb3!8m2!3d58.487952!4d19.863281!16zL20vMDE1MjI?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) were recently disrupted, raising concerns about possible sabotage amid heightened Russian activity in the region. According to the Swedish company [Telia](https://www.teliacompany.com/en), a cable connecting Lithuania and Sweden was physically damaged on Sunday, while another linking Finland and Germany, operated by [Cinia](https://www.cinia.fi/en/), was also severed. Both incidents occurred within proximity of one another, which has prompted investigations.

Cinia‚Äôs CEO indicated the disruption to the C-Lion cable, Finland‚Äôs primary data link to Central Europe, suggests outside interference. Finland and Germany are concerned over potential ‚Äúhybrid warfare‚Äù with the rising geopolitical tensions with Russia. These incidents come as new NATO members Finland and Sweden prepare their citizens for potential conflict and distribute guidance on surviving wartime scenarios. The U.S. recently reported increased [Russian military activity](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/06/politics/us-sees-increasing-risk-of-russian-sabotage-undersea-cables/index.html) near undersea cables, fueling fears of sabotage. Authorities continue to investigate while repairs are underway.

### Hong Kong freedom

![Global condemnation follows sentencing of Hong Kong 47 activists under national security law](/images/hong-kong_-45-activists-jailed-in-national-security-case-QzNj.webp)

The sentencing of [Hong Kong 47](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/19/hong-kong-democracy-activists-jailed-who-are-they-whats-the-case-about), a group of pro-democracy activists, has received widespread criticism from around the world. Under Beijing‚Äôs national security law, the activists were charged with organizing unofficial primary elections in 2020 and accused of plotting to undermine the government. The sentences ranged from a few to 10 years, with legal scholar Benny Tai receiving the heaviest punishment as the alleged mastermind. Critics argue that the law, imposed after 2019‚Äôs mass protests, has been used to silence dissent and tighten Beijing‚Äôs control of Hong Kong.¬†

Groups around the world [condemned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/international-outrage-sentencing-pro-democracy-activists-hong-kong) the sentences as politically motivated, labeling them an attack on fundamental freedoms and democratic participation. The case illustrates Hong Kong‚Äôs fading autonomy under the ‚Äúone country, two systems‚Äù framework. International observers warn it sets a dangerous precedent, where peaceful political activity can result in severe penalties, further eroding civil liberties.

### EU sticks with Israel

European Union foreign ministers have [rejected](https://www.dw.com/en/eu-ministers-reject-suspending-dialogue-with-israel/a-70807176) a proposal by Josep Borrell, the bloc‚Äôs foreign policy chief, to suspend diplomatic dialogue with Israel. [Borrell](https://www.middleeasteye.net/live-blog/live-blog-update/borrell-proposes-suspension-political-dialogue-israel) has a critical stance on Israel and suggested the move as a response to Israeli actions in Gaza, citing severe humanitarian impacts, which include the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians. The proposal is seen as Borrell‚Äôs bold parting move before leaving office. It required unanimous support from the 27 EU member states but faced opposition from nations like Germany, Hungary, Austria, and the Netherlands.

Instead, ministers opted to maintain the EU-Israel dialogue under the Association Agreement, which emphasizes cooperation based on mutual respect for human rights. Meanwhile, Borrell also proposed a [ban on imports](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/war-gaza-we-cannot-continue-business-usual_en) from Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law, though this measure was not widely discussed. Separately, the ministers approved new sanctions on Iran and supported broader military options for Ukraine. The situation with Ukraine is less polarized in the EU than Israel and Palestine. Most EU nations are more or less on the same page on Ukraine and Iran, likely due to less nuance in these situations.¬†

**üá¨üá™ Georgia:** Abkhazia‚Äôs president, Aslan Bzhania, [resigned](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241119-abkhazia-moscow-president-protesters) on Tuesday after reaching an agreement with demonstrators who protested against a proposed investment deal with Russia. The [protests](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241115-protesters-in-georgia-s-breakaway-region-abkhazia-storm-parliament-over-russian-investment-measure) in Sukhumi reflected fears that the deal could alter the region‚Äôs character. Demonstrators blocked roads and occupied government buildings, demanding Bzhania‚Äôs resignation. He cited the need for stability and constitutional order in his resignation letter. The protesters vacated government premises, and Bzhania‚Äôs deputy will serve as acting president. [Abkhazia](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18175030), recognized as part of Georgia, has been under de facto Russian control since the [2008 Russia-Georgia war](https://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/13/world/europe/2008-georgia-russia-conflict/index.html). Amid the unrest, Moscow has advised its citizens to avoid traveling to the region.

**üá∑üá∫ Russia:** Russian President Vladimir Putin has [lowered](https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-91f20e0c9b0f9e5eaa3ed97c35789898) the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, permitting retaliation against conventional attacks from nations supported by nuclear powers. Putin made this decision in response to Ukraine‚Äôs [missile strike](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mzjm7knw7o) on Russia‚Äôs [Bryansk](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bryansk+Oblast,+Russia/@52.9331984,31.9655996,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x46d2d14dcf496edf:0x102a3a583f19610!8m2!3d53.0408599!4d33.26909!16zL20vMDJmNDc5?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) region, which the United States approved. The revised doctrine expands the circumstances under which nuclear weapons could be used, drawing condemnation from the West as an act of reckless escalation. However, U.S. officials have reported that there has been no change in Russia‚Äôs nuclear posture.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why is the First Lady important in the US?**

![Melania Trump redefined the evolving role of First Lady](/images/how-did-the-role-of-first-lady-in-the-us-become-an-important-role-in-comparison-with-with-rest-of-the-world_-EwOT.webp)

Melania Trump‚Äôs [decision](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/13/politics/melania-trump-white-house/index.html) to reduce her role as first lady has changed the traditional role of first lady. The U.S. places significant emphasis on the role of the First Lady due to historical, cultural, and symbolic reasons. It is one of the few countries that still really place such an importance on it. Some countries even see it as irresponsible for a leader to have a family, as many believe it is hard to fulfill the roles of both a head of state and a head of family.¬†

While there is no legal requirement and first last isn‚Äôt an official political office, the First Lady often embodies national values and ideals, representing the ‚Äúfirst family‚Äù as a symbol of American identity.¬†

Historically, First Ladies took on influential roles by promoting social causes and advocating for education, health, and family issues. The First Lady can play an informal diplomatic role, representing the U.S. at home and abroad by strengthening international relationships through cultural exchange. However, some critics say this role is outdated. Most of the first ladies of the 21st century had their prestigious career backgrounds.¬†
