On Saturday, Russia and Ukraine exchanged 115 prisoners of war. This day coincided with Ukrainian Independence Day from the Soviet Union. This is the third independence day Ukraine has had since the start of the war. Most of the Ukrainian ones freed were conscripts who were captured at the beginning of the war. Many of them have suffered from medical neglect. The ones on the Russian side mainly were taken from the Ukrainian takeover of the Kursk region a couple of weeks ago. The United Arab Emirates brokered this exchange. Last January, there was a more extensive exchange where hundreds were swapped out.

### Issues with the Philippines and China

The Philippines is now accusing China of flaring fires within 15 of their aircraft. Last week, both countries had a ship collision, for which both sides blamed the other. The Philippines have also accused China of harassment. China and the Philippines tried restoring several of its South China disputes last month. However, it has gone out the window last week. The South China Sea is an area of contention with China and several Southeast Asian countries, even Vietnam, China’s ideological ally. The Philippines is one of the US's strongest allies. However, it is not certain how much the US would be willing to risk escalation in China over this dispute.

### Israel-Hezbollah conflict

Hezbollah and Israeli forces have exchanged attacks across the Lebanon-Israel border. Israel made a preemptive strike on Sunday morning, Hezbollah followed with a series of missile attacks. The Israeli military claimed that Hezbollah would launch hundreds of missiles toward central Israel at 5 am, Israel’s Army Radio said, so it attacked half an hour beforehand with 100 Israeli jets. Israeli and Hezbollah forces have been engaged in tit-for-tat strikes a few times within the last few months. Hezbollah says it will stop if there is a ceasefire agreement put in place in Gaza.

### Euroskepticism is rising in Eastern Germany

Germany has been looking nervously at several of its states from the East. The polls show that the support is towards either AFD ( Alternative for Germany) or the Sahra Wagenknecht group. The AFD party is famous for being anti-immigrant and far-right. Meanwhile, the Sahra Wagenknect group is more of a “ conservative leftist” movement, meaning they are fiscally left and socially conservative. Both parties are skeptical of the European Union and giving aid to Ukraine. Two of these states, Thurigngen and Saxony, have their elections on September 1st. The state of Brandenburg will be a couple of weeks later. This issue highlights there are some key differences between East and West Germany nearly 35 years after reunification.

### North Korea opens to Western tourists for the first time in nearly five years

North Korea has given the green light for tourism starting in December. North Korea has been closed since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. The only people allowed were foreign dignitaries and some groups from mainly Russia and China. Now, they are ready to take everyone else. However, an exception seems to be tourists from the United States. While North Korea hasn’t explicitly banned US American tourists, the U.S. State Department has banned US citizens from going; as a result, most of the tourist groups who organize these trips won’t accept any tourists traveling on U.S. passports.
