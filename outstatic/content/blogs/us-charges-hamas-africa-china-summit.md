### US charges Hamas leaders with terrorism

The US Justice Department has announced [charges on Hamas](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/03/g-s1-20701/hamas-terrorism-us-israel-middle-east) leader Yahya Sinwar and five other Hamas leaders of terrorism. The Hamas leaders face seven counts, including conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization resulting in death and conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals. The death of Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg Polin will be investigated.

This announcement is almost 11 months after Hamas launched the attacks on October 7th. These charges were in the making for a while; the recent death of Hersh likely jumpstarted this into action. Many Americans and others are divided on this decision. While it holds Hamas accountable, many say that Nethyanahu needs to be held to the same standards.

African leaders are meeting in China with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the next few days. The [China-Africa summit](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/4/china-africa-summit-2024-whats-in-it-for-beijing-and-for-africa) is held every three years. The meetings revolve primarily around various projects with China’s Belt and Road initiative, a giant project that connects China with other regions of the world. China holds the place as Africa’s leading trading partner.

China aims to counter Western influence in Africa and other developing regions of the world and transform itself into a global superpower. These projects and investments in African countries also help it gain more influence as one of the main players in the Security Council.

### Russian media celebrates German right-wing win

Many Russian media commentators are overjoyed to welcome the [election results](https://www.dw.com/en/why-russian-propaganda-celebrates-the-far-right-win-in-germany/a-70124057) in Germany's regional elections. They see this as supporting Russia’s interests in Ukraine. They believe the far-right Alternative for Germany ( AFD) and the” populist left” Sahra Wagenknect party ( BSW) are important assets for Moscow.

The most noticeable thing is that these parties favor a ceasefire in Ukraine. These gains hinder Germany’s role in providing economic and military support for Ukraine. Professors and IR experts also say it serves as an example to show Russians that Western democracy is not always a good example. It plays into all the helpful talking points for Russian media.

### Russia Strikes Western Ukraine

A Russian drone and missile attacked the Western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Wednesday; [the attack](https://www.dw.com/en/russian-attack-on-lviv-kills-at-least-7-wounds-dozens/video-70134879) killed seven people, including four members of the same family. Lviv is considered rather far from the part of Ukraine where the heavy fighting has been happening. Lyviv was considered the “safe part” of most of the war.

Aside from the tragic loss of life and extensive property damage, a key issue this brings up is that Lyiv isn’t that far from the Polish border. If Russian drones keep at it in Western Ukraine, they risk the chance of having one hit Polish territory. Poland is a significant member of NATO, so it would be in some hot water if it accidentally attacked Poland.

### Former Austrian PM gets a job with Putin

Former Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl is returning to diplomacy. Instead of working for Austria, she is now a new [part of Putin’s team](https://www.politico.eu/article/austrian-ex-minister-becomes-vladimir-putins-tiger-ambassador/). She is the ambassador for the conservation of Siberian tigers. She was head of the Austrian foreign ministry in Vienna from 2017 to 2019. She was a member of the far-right Freedom Party. She made headlines for dancing with Vladimir Putin himself during her wedding in 2018.

The far-right Freedom Party was involved in a series of scandals in 2019 regarding collusion with Russia. Austria has its federal election in 2018, and this party is projected to do very well. So, the Kremlin might have some more friends soon.
