### ICC arrest warrants

![ICC arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders over alleged Gaza conflict war crimes](/images/icc-arrest-warrants-for-israel-s-netanyahu-and-gallant--hamas-s-deif--1--AwOT.webp)

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has [issued](https://apnews.com/article/icc-israel-hamas-warrants-netanyahu-palestinian-arrest-73c854d072e0a1a41b19b2cb2cdd07fa#https://apnews.com/article/icc-israel-hamas-warrants-netanyahu-palestinian-arrest-73c854d072e0a1a41b19b2cb2cdd07fa) arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, former defense minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas leaders over alleged war crimes linked to the Gaza conflict and the October 2023 attacks. The charges include depriving Gaza‚Äôs civilian population of vital supplies and crimes committed during the Hamas-led assaults on Israel.¬†

While the warrants could complicate international travel for Israeli officials, their practical enforcement is uncertain since Israel and the U.S. are not ICC members, and some Hamas leaders are already dead. In addition, countries that are ICC members do not always arrest someone with a warrant. This was shown earlier this year when Vladimir Putin, also with a warrant from the ICC, visited [Mongolia](https://www.politico.eu/article/mongolia-failure-arrest-vladimir-putin-international-warrant-international-criminal-court/), which is an ICC member, and they did not arrest him. The move does highlight growing calls for accountability in the ongoing conflict.

### US defends veto

![U.S. veto at the UN Security Council over a Gaza ceasefire resolution](/images/us-defends-veto-of-un-security-council-resolution-on-gaza-ceasefire--1--EwNz.webp)

The U.S. has [vetoed](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr4p9rg8zlo) a draft resolution at the UN Security Council that called for an immediate, unconditional ceasefire in Gaza, marking its fourth veto in the ongoing conflict. The resolution, supported by 14 out of 15 Council members, also emphasized the release of all hostages and rejected the starvation of Palestinians. The reason given for the veto was there was a lack of linkage between a ceasefire and the hostages‚Äô release as a critical flaw, arguing the resolution could encourage Hamas.

The veto drew significant backlash. China‚Äôs ambassador questioned the value placed on Palestinian lives, while France and the UK condemned the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. However, one thing to be noted is that all resolutions made by the Security Council are often nonbinding. In many cases, vetos by council members are merely symbolic and, in some cases, made to counter a geopolitical rival, especially among the [Big Five](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/un-security-council#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Security%20Council's%20structure%3F&text=The%20Security%20Council%20has%20five,collectively%20known%20as%20the%20P5.) members.¬†

### China and Brazil ties

China and Brazil have [strengthened](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/20/lula-and-xi-sign-dozens-of-trade-deals-as-brazil-china-ties-deepen) their ties by signing nearly 40 trade and development agreements during President Xi Jinping‚Äôs visit to Brasilia. The accords span areas including trade, technology, and environmental protection, marking a ‚Äúnew phase‚Äù in their relationship. Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva expressed confidence that this partnership would open new doors and surpass expectations.¬†

China remains Brazil‚Äôs largest trading partner, with bilateral trade exceeding $160 billion in 2023. Brazil primarily exports soybeans and other commodities while importing semiconductors, vehicles, and medicines from China. Brazil also has one of the largest [Chinese diasporas](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2023-03-25/The-growth-of-the-Chinese-immigrants-in-Brazil-1isy6S0ZLPi/index.html) in South America. This meeting follows Xi‚Äôs attendance at the G20 and APEC summits. His visits are indicative of China‚Äôs growing [influence](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/19/beijing-is-doubling-down-on-latin-america-outreach-for-influence-and-trade.html) in Latin America. Lula‚Äôs efforts aim to balance ties with the U.S., China, and Russia, carving out Brazil‚Äôs unique geopolitical role amid shifting global dynamics.

**üáªüá™ Venezuela:** The U.S. has officially [recognized](https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-presidential-election-maduro-colombia-petro-g20-f2c27ee80ed50cae7109499a23c59552) Edmundo Gonz√°lez as Venezuela‚Äôs ‚Äúpresident-elect,‚Äù challenging Nicol√°s Maduro‚Äôs claim of victory in the July 28 election. Secretary of State Antony Blinken affirmed that Gonz√°lez had won most votes and called for adherence to Venezuelans‚Äô democratic will. Venezuela‚Äôs electoral council, dominated by Maduro loyalists, declared him the winner without releasing the details of his vote.¬† Opposition leaders posted tally sheets online indicating Gonz√°lez won by a wide margin. Many international community members have raised concerns about the election‚Äôs credibility. Despite growing global condemnation, Maduro is preparing for his swearing-in for another term starting in January 2025.

**üá∫üá¨ Uganda:** Kizza Besigye, a Ugandan opposition leader, was [reportedly kidnapped](https://www.dw.com/en/prominent-uganda-opposition-figure-kidnapped-and-jailed/a-70828167) in Kenya and returned to Uganda, facing military court charges for unlawful firearm possession, which he denies. His wife, Winnie Byanyima, is questioning the legality of his detention and demanding his release. The incident, occurring during a book launch in Kenya, has drawn criticism of President Museveni‚Äôs government for suppressing dissent. Kenya has not commented. This situation highlights ongoing human rights abuses in Uganda, as seen with other opposition figures like Bobi Wine amid rising political repression.¬†

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why does the UN allow vetoes?**

![UN veto system and its role in maintaining global power balance](/images/why-does-the-un-veto-system-exist_--1--AxND.webp)

The [veto system](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/content/voting-system) exists in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to ensure that the world‚Äôs significant powers support and cooperate with the UN, particularly in matters of peace and security. It was designed after World War II to maintain a balance of power and prevent the paralysis that doomed the [League of Nations](https://www.britannica.com/topic/League-of-Nations), the UN‚Äôs predecessor. By granting veto power, the system ensures that no significant military or political action can proceed without the agreement of the most powerful countries.¬†

The five countries with permanent vetos are the US, China, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom. They were the victors of World War II and were thought to represent different power blocs at the time, such as the West, Asia, and the Soviet sphere.¬†

A permanent member can block any substantive resolution by casting a ‚Äúno‚Äù vote. Even if the other 14 council members agree, the resolution cannot pass. Many have called for removing this, as many members vote based on their interests or countering a geopolitical rival. Also, many geopolitical considerations were made into this system in 1945, which differ from today's. Many also find fault in larger countries like India not having the same access to it as China or that no African members have a veto.¬†
