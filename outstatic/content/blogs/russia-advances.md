### Russian troops advancing in Pokrovsk

While Ukraine has been making progress in taking over the Russian city of Kursk, Russian troops have been closing in on the city of Pokorvsk in Eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian government has told Pokrovsk's remaining 53,000 residents to flee. Many have already fled, and the Russian army is coming closer. Pkrovsk is one of Ukraine's main defensive strongholds in the Donetsk region. If the Russian army takes it, it would be a blow to Ukrainian morale, which has been at a high since Ukraine successfully managed to cross Russian borders and take over Kursk, which has been a big blow to Putin.

### Iran threatens with retaliation

Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel once again. This comes from the recent assassination of one of Hama’s leaders, Ismail Haniyeh, who was in Iran on July 31st. Israel has not confirmed or denied its involvement in the assassination. The Iranian government has said this stands even if there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Iran states that it is simply about punishing the aggressor and creating deterrence. Israel and Hamas are gridlocked in a conflict. Both sides have turned down different ceasefire proposals. A retaliation from Iran will likely add more fuel to the fire. The question is more about whether Iran will retaliate or not.

### Putin offers to mediate the Armenia and Azerbaijan conflict

Putin recently met with Azeri President Aliyev in Baku, Azerbaijan. In his visit, he offered to mediate a peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Both countries have been in a conflict over disputed territory for the last 30 years; things have heated up in the last several years when Azerbaijan took back a heavily disputed region. Armenia has accused Azerbaijan of genocide. While this conflict is technically only 30 years old, these disputes occurred before the Soviet Union. While Armenia has a long friendship with Russia, Putin has not intervened in the case of Armenia. Armenia has looked toward improving cooperation with the West in the last several years.

### Bangladesh interim PM pledges support for Rohingya refugees

Bangladesh's interim prime minister, Muhammad Yunus, has made the situation with the Rohingya refugees his priority in foreign policy. Many have been fleeing neighboring Myanmar once again to escape the increase in violence and persecution. He said the government is prepared to support the millions of Rohingya currently in Bangladesh. He believes they can help revive the garment industry in Bangladesh. Many have been there since 2017, when the government put a military crackdown on them. This situation adds to Yunus's big plate. He returned to Bangladesh to lead the country after a coup ousted the last Prime Minister.

India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced he will visit Ukraine on Friday, making him the first Indian Prime minister to do so. He will also visit some other countries, including neighboring Poland, one of the most supportive countries towards Ukraine. He was criticized last month for visiting Putin. Modi seeks to have good relations with both the West and Russia. India is one of the top buyers of Russian weapons. He states he was unhappy with Russia’s war but does not see it as a binary choice. Modi has also been criticized for aligning with the West on the subject of Israel.
