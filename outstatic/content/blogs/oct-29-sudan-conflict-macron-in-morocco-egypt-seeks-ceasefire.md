### Paramilitary rampage in Sudan

![Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) reportedly kill over 120 civilians in Gezira province](/images/at-least-120-killed-in-paramilitary-rampage-on-sudanese-villages-E3Mz.jpg)

The Sudanese paramilitary [Rapid Support Forces (RSF)](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/16/sudan-unrest-what-is-the-rapid-support-forces) reportedly killed over 120 civilians and displaced thousands in Gezira province during [days of attacks](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241026-activists-say-50-killed-in-sudan-paramilitary-attack) involving violence, looting, and sexual assaults. Following setbacks against the Sudanese military, the RSF intensified attacks in areas where they had lost control, prompting condemnation from the United Nations and international organizations.¬†

The [conflict](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/power-struggle-sudan) between the RSF and the Sudanese military has been ongoing since April 2023, which has led to widespread violence, displacements, and atrocities against civilians. The RSF receives a lot of backing from the UAE. The UAE provides financial aid to address Sudan‚Äôs humanitarian crisis while reportedly [supplying arms to Sudan‚Äôs RSF](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/sudan-rsf-key-ally-uae-logistical-and-corporate-interests) in its ongoing conflict. Experts suggest this dual strategy aligns with Abu Dhabi‚Äôs interest in Sudan‚Äôs agricultural resources, land, and control over strategic Red Sea ports.

### Macron in Morocco

![French President Emmanuel Macron visits Morocco to strengthen diplomatic and economic relations with King Mohammed VI and Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch](/images/france-s-macron-to-visit-morocco-gxMT.jpg)

French President Emmanuel Macron is on an [official visit](https://www.euronews.com/2024/10/28/macron-visiting-morocco-amid-new-honeymoon-over-western-sahara-pivot) to Morocco to boost the diplomatic and economic relations between the two nations. Macron will meet with King Mohammed VI and Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch. The discussions will focus on several critical areas, including trade relations, security cooperation, and immigration policies.¬†

This visit is notable as it is Macron's first trip to Morocco since he expressed [public support](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240730-france-backs-morocco-s-autonomy-plan-for-disputed-western-sahara) for Moroccan sovereignty over [Western Sahara](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14115273). This position caused controversy and heightened tensions with neighboring Algeria. Historically, France and Morocco have maintained a robust relationship, with France recognized as Morocco‚Äôs leading trading partner. Macron‚Äôs visit reinforces this strategic partnership as both nations seek to navigate and respond to regional dynamics.

### Egypt proposes ceasefire

Egypt‚Äôs President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has put forth the plan for a [two-day cease-fire](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/egypt-president-cease-fire-proposal-gaza-israel-palestine/) between Israel and Hamas. The plan includes the release of four hostages held by Hamas and some Palestinian prisoners, alongside the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. This proposal, marking Egypt‚Äôs first public plan since the war‚Äôs escalation, aims to facilitate further negotiations for a permanent cease-fire. Reactions from Israel and Hamas are pending, but ongoing discussions involving high-level officials from Israel, the U.S., and Qatar are expected.

Egypt is in a unique position, being located between Israel and Gaza. While much of the population is sympathetic towards Gaza, it has semi-satisfactory [relations with Israel](https://www.usip.org/publications/2024/06/five-factors-shaping-future-egypt-israel-relations) officially despite being on the decline [(watch video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JhmyyMGOJA). It holds a position that could be powerful in brokering something constructive but has come short of this goal.

**üá¨üá™ Georgia:** Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili has [rejected the recent election results](https://www.dw.com/en/georgias-president-says-election-has-been-stolen/a-70621642), accusing the ruling [Georgian Dream party](https://www.dw.com/en/georgia-ruling-georgian-dream-party-wins-election/a-70611564) of fraud and labeling the election ‚Äústolen.‚Äù She highlighted alleged cases of voter intimidation and fraud. She called for public protests, stressing that Georgia‚Äôs [pro-European aspirations](https://www.dw.com/en/georgias-path-to-the-eu-looms-large-in-2024-election/a-70590398) are at risk under the Georgian Dream, which she claims is moving toward authoritarianism and closer ties with Russia. Zourabichvili also urged the EU to pressure Georgian Dream to honor democratic commitments and called for transparent elections.

**üáπüáº Taiwan:** The United States has approved a [$2 billion arms sale](https://apnews.com/article/us-taiwan-china-arms-sale-missile-defense-bd14986ada9cfc894c5b1168aea27d02) to Taiwan, including advanced [NASAMS air defense systems](https://www.rtx.com/raytheon/what-we-do/integrated-air-and-missile-defense/nasams) and radar equipment, significantly boosting Taiwan‚Äôs military capabilities. Taiwan‚Äôs government expressed gratitude, highlighting its importance for regional stability. [China](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59900139) sees Taiwan as part of its territory and strongly condemned the sale, citing risks to sovereignty and security and hinting at potential countermeasures. The U.S. has been Taiwan‚Äôs key defense partner amid increasing military tensions in the [Taiwan Strait](https://www.britannica.com/event/Taiwan-Strait-crises). However, the US still officially recognizes the [One-China policy](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-38285354).¬†

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why did Eastern Europe reject the Marshall Plan?**

![Map showing the Molotov Plan's influence over Eastern European countries rejecting the Marshall Plan during the Cold War](/images/molotov-plan-cwND.jpg)

Eastern European countries largely rejected the [Marshall Plan](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/marshall-plan#:~:text=On%20April%203%2C%201948%2C%20President,economic%20infrastructure%20of%20postwar%20Europe.) due to intense pressure from the Soviet Union, which saw the plan as a strategy by the United States to expand capitalist influence and undermine Soviet control over the region. The [Soviet Union rejected the Marshall Plan](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/soviet-union-rejects-marshall-plan-assistance) in 1947. Several Eastern European nations, including Poland and Czechoslovakia, initially showed interest in the economic aid offered through the Marshall Plan, recognizing the potential benefits of post-war recovery. However, these countries were coerced into rejecting the assistance to maintain loyalty to Soviet policies.¬†

Read more about the Marshal Plan in [previous Foundations](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/lithuania-opposition-russian-strikes-kill-7-israel-and-iran).

In response to the rejection of the Marshall Plan, the Soviet Union introduced the [Molotov Plan](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-hccc-worldhistory2/chapter/the-marshall-plan-and-molotov-plan/), which aimed to create an alternative framework for economic cooperation among Eastern European nations. This plan facilitated trade and mutual economic support within the Soviet sphere, ensuring that these countries remained closely aligned with Soviet interests rather than integrating into the capitalist economies of the West. The Molotov Plan thus solidified the economic divide between Eastern and Western Europe during the early years of the Cold War.
