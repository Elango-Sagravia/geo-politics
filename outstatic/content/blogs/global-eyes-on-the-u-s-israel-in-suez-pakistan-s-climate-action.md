### The world watches the US

![](/images/world-watches-election-gyMT.webp)

After months of endless news headlines, [election day](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/1/us-election-who-do-world-leaders-prefer-for-president-harris-or-trump) has arrived in the US. Many around the world are also eagerly and anxiously awaiting the results. Americans will not be the only ones glued to their TVs and laptops. Many believe that the results will significantly affect the world, while others believe that US foreign policy is fixed and they don‚Äôt matter.

¬†[Russia](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/10/russia-maintains-support-for-trump-in-2024-election-race-officials-say) favors a Trump presidency more, while Ukraine prefers a Harris presidency, as it would likely continue U.S. policies that support Ukraine. [China](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/31/china/china-reaction-us-election-intl-hnk/index.html) has a neutral stance toward both candidates, although Harris may be more amicable, and a Trump presidency could lead to [increased tariffs](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2018/11/30/trumps-trade-war-with-china-how-we-got-here-what-happens-next) on China, which raises concerns for them. In the [Middle East](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yv9k3mpmo), opinions are divided: Israeli leadership favors Trump, but public opinion in Israel is mixed, with about two-thirds supporting Trump. The Palestinians feel hopeless regarding either candidate. There is a preference for Harris in Latin America, although some countries, like Argentina, lean towards Trump.

### Israeli warship crosses Suez

![](/images/israel-warship-travels-through-egypt-s-suez-canal-k2Nz.webp)

The Suez Canal Authority recently [confirmed](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-warship-passes-through-suez-canal-egypt-clarifies-6939399) that all vessels, including military and commercial ships, can navigate the canal freely, regardless of their nationality, which is in line with the [Constantinople Convention](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Constantinople-Convention) of 1888, which mandates unrestricted passage through the Suez Canal. This statement was in response to [public outrage](https://www.aljazeera.com/program/newsfeed/2024/11/3/outrage-over-israeli-warship-passing-through-the-suez-canal) over an Israeli warship transiting the waterway, with the [SCA](https://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/English/Pages/default.aspx) clarifying that the vessel complied with protocol by flying both Israeli and Egyptian flags.¬†

Amid rising criticism, Egypt‚Äôs military adamantly denied accusations from social media suggesting support for Israeli military actions in Gaza. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi highlighted that the conflict has financially impacted canal revenue, resulting in an estimated $6 billion in losses due to escalating regional tensions.

### Pakistan‚Äôs climate diplomacy

Punjab, Pakistan, has made a rare appeal for [collaboration](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/04/asia/pakistan-punjab-climate-diplomacy-india-smog-intl-hnk/index.html) with India to address severe air pollution, as Lahore and Delhi face hazardous air quality levels. [Lahore](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lahore,+Punjab,+Pakistan/@31.4831276,74.1695796,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x39190483e58107d9:0xc23abe6ccc7e2462!8m2!3d31.5203696!4d74.3587473!16zL20vMHhudDU?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAyOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), located just 15 miles from the Indian border, recently recorded its highest air quality index, surpassing 1,900 in some areas far above hazardous levels. Punjab‚Äôs Secretary for Environment and Climate Change, Raja Jahangir Anwar, called for ‚Äúclimate diplomacy,‚Äù recognizing the need for joint action on this transboundary issue.

Winter [air pollution](https://www.iqair.com/pakistan/punjab/lahore) spikes due to crop stubble burning, vehicle emissions, and stagnant air, creating a seasonal yellow haze over northern India and eastern Pakistan. While both countries have introduced measures to limit stubble burning, the practice persists. Schools have been [closed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/3/schools-to-close-as-air-pollution-hits-record-high-in-pakistans-lahore) in various parts of eastern Pakistan. While some ministers call for collaboration, other ministers blame India for the situation.

**üáπüá∑ Turkey:** The Turkish government has removed [three pro-Kurdish mayors](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-unseats-three-pro-kurdish-mayors) from Mardin, Batman, and Halfeti, replacing them with government-appointed trustees due to alleged terrorism-related charges. This move, announced by Turkey‚Äôs Ministry of the Interior, follows accusations of ties to the [Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK)](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kurdistan-Workers-Party), a group designated as terrorist by Turkey and its Western allies. The mayors, all from the pro-Kurdish Peoples‚Äô Equality and Democracy Party (Dem), have not been detained, but their ousting has stirred strong responses, with critics calling it politically motivated.

**üáÆüá± Israel:** A political scandal has [erupted in Israel](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-leak-scandal-netanyahu-aide-arrested-gaza-hostage-talks-rcna178617) after reports that Eliezer Feldstein, an aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, may have leaked classified intelligence related to hostage negotiations with Hamas. Israeli courts recently eased a gag order, allowing details of the investigation into Feldstein's alleged misuse of IDF intelligence to surface. Netanyahu denied any prior knowledge of the leak. Critics, including political opponents and families of hostages, claim it reflects political manipulation of sensitive information to counter calls for a ceasefire amidst the Gaza conflict. Figures like Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid condemned the incident as a serious security breach, with hostage families expressing feelings of betrayal over the government's handling of the situation.

**What is the status of Puerto Rico to the United States?**

![](/images/puerto-rico-ExND.webp)

Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States, which means it is governed by U.S. federal law but does not have the full rights of a state. Although Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, they cannot [vote](https://thehill.com/homenews/4960708-heres-why-millions-of-americans-in-puerto-rico-other-territories-cant-vote-for-president/) in U.S. presidential elections and do not have voting representation in Congress. However, they can vote if they reside in another part of the United States.¬†

The status of Puerto Rico has been a subject of ongoing debate, with discussions centered around [statehood](https://www.pr51st.com/), independence, and maintaining its current territorial status. In recent years, referendums have indicated support for statehood among Puerto Ricans, but any significant change requires legislative action from Congress. Many believe statehood is needed to give more rights and representation to Puerto Ricans. A strong and growing independence movement in Puerto Rico also advocates for complete [independence](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/puerto-rico-prepares-election-day-party-candidate-makes-115435157) from the United States.
