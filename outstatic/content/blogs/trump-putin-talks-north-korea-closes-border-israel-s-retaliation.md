### Trump Accused of Post-Presidency Talks with Putin

A Kremlin spokesperson confirmed that the Trump administration did [send medical equipment to Vladimir Putin](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kemlin-trump-putin-covid-equipment-denial-b2626809.html) at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, contradicting Trump’s campaign denial of any such exchange. Dmitry Peskov acknowledged communication between Moscow and Washington about equipment but denied claims from journalist Bob Woodward’s upcoming book that Trump and Putin had phone calls after Trump left office. Trump dismissed the equipment claim as false, while Woodward’s book alleges that Putin requested testing machines for personal use, asking for secrecy to protect his reputation.

While this is alleged content in a book, it is evident that Trump would show less support for Ukraine in its war than the Biden-Harris administration. Trump said several times he would [end the war](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/17/whats-donald-trumps-plan-to-end-russias-war-on-ukraine) if elected. He also had a tense [meeting with Zelensky](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810y11dyjo) recently. Most of the European continent is watching the 2024 election with anticipation because Ukraine's future could evolve differently depending on which candidate gets elected.

### North Korea Shuts Border with South Korea

North Korea has announced that it will permanently [close its border](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/10/09/north-korea-set-to-permanently-shut-border-with-south-korea_6728721_4.html) with South Korea and strengthen its front-line defenses in response to what it describes as increasing military provocations from South Korean and U.S. forces. In response, South Korea's military issued a strong warning, stating they would not tolerate any attempts to change the current status quo. 

The border closure comes amid a broader deterioration in inter-Korean relations, with cross-border exchanges and diplomacy effectively frozen in recent years. The escalations with North and South Korea vastly differ from the efforts made in 2018 to promote Korean unity. The two nations marched together under the same flag at the [Olympics held in South Korea](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43063399) and formed a declaration of peace two months later. Now, there is less hope of normalizing relations between the two Koreas. 

### Thunberg Says Germany Silences Pro-Palestinian Voices

![Greta Thunberg's visit prompts the dismantling of a pro-Palestinian protest camp](/images/greta-thunberg-ExMT.webp)

German police dismantled a pro-Palestinian protest camp in Dortmund after hearing that [Greta Thunberg](https://www.dw.com/en/greta-thunberg-says-germany-silencing-pro-palestinian-cause/a-70443304) was scheduled to visit. Thunberg was present at a similar Berlin protest, subsequently accusing German authorities of silencing activists, especially those speaking out for Palestinians. The police cited concerns over potential violence and the likelihood of a larger crowd than initially planned due to Thunberg’s presence.

There has been a lot of discussion in Germany and other Western countries precisely on how much the “Free Palestine” movement is censored. Some activists feel they are unfairly treated, while others assert they have the freedom to voice their dissent against the Israeli government as long as it is done peacefully. The lines between all these elements become blurred into a gray area. While a lot of the protests have gone on peacefully, there has been a rise in [anti-semitic behavior in Europe](https://www.statista.com/topics/5169/antisemitism-in-europe/) from both the far right and the far left. 

### Israel Promises Retaliation Against Iran

Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned on Wednesday that [retaliation for a recent Iranian missile attack](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/09/israel-warns-iran-yoav-gallant-00183190) would be “lethal” and “surprising.” This comes as the Israeli military intensifies its operations in northern Gaza and engages in a ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently [spoke with President Biden](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/biden-backs-israel-taiwan-national-day-election-attack-prevented) for the first time in weeks, discussing Israel’s strategic response to Iran.

Iran launched a series of missiles at Israel last week in response to Israel's ground offensive in Lebanon and the killing of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah [(see previous issue)](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/nasrallah-out-baltic-states-and-poland-want-more). World leaders condemned Iran's actions but are also growing concerned about potential Israeli retaliation against Iran, even among their allies. While many allies acknowledge Israel's [right to self-defense,](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/g-s1-19232/kamala-harris-israel-gaza-dnc) they are hesitant about the prospect of a regional war.

### Zelensky Meets with Macron

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on October 10, 2024, as part of a European tour [to secure military and financial support](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241010-zelensky-arrives-in-paris-ahead-of-talks-with-macron) amid concerns over dwindling backing from the U.S. ahead of its presidential election. During the visit, Macron stressed that France has “unwavering support” for Ukraine and reiterated the commitment to assist in its ongoing conflict with Russia.

Zelensky’s tour includes stops in London, Rome, and Berlin, highlighting the urgent need for reinforcement as Ukraine faces severe winter challenges due to Russian strikes. He has already met UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to discuss his [“victory plan,”](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4zvd7ldzko) which includes calls for enhanced security guarantees and weaponry.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why is French Guiana still part of France?**

French Guiana is an overseas region of France located on the northeastern coast of South America. It became part of France in the 17th century and was officially integrated as a department in 1946. This status means it is subject to French law and governance, providing residents access to social services, education, and healthcare similar to mainland France. Its unique position allows it to benefit from European Union membership while retaining a rich cultural heritage influenced by indigenous, African, and European traditions. This combination of history and legal status firmly establishes French Guiana as an integral part of France.

French Guiana is also home to the [European Space Agency (ESA)](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Europe_s_Spaceport/Europe_s_Spaceport2). The agency operates the Guiana Space Centre (Centre Spatial Guyanais, CSG), a crucial mission launch site. Located in [Kourou](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Operations/ESA_Ground_Stations/Kourou_station#:~:text=The%20Kourou%20S%2D%20and%20X,\(CSG\)%2C%20Europe's%20Spaceport.), the spaceport benefits from its proximity to the equator, allowing for more efficient launches. Since its establishment in 1968, CSG has hosted numerous satellite launches, including Ariane, Soyuz, and Vega rockets. The site is essential for ESA’s projects and collaborations with other space agencies, contributing significantly to advancements in satellite technology and space exploration.
