### U.S. pressures Israel

![U.S. raises concerns over Gaza civilian casualties and UN aid restrictions, as support for Israel divides public opinion](/images/us-is-increasingly-more-critical-on-israel-Y4Mz.webp)

The U.S. has called on Israel for an [explanation](https://www.dw.com/en/middle-east-us-condemns-horrifying-israeli-strike-on-gaza/live-70624186) following an airstrike in Beit Lahiya, Gaza, that reportedly killed numerous civilians, including children. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller described the incident as ‚Äúhorrifying‚Äù and expressed concerns over the significant loss of civilian life. Meanwhile, the UN condemned Israel‚Äôs decision to [ban the UNRWA](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/unwra-banned-in-israel-north-korean-troops-in-russia-chad-attacked), the UN‚Äôs agency aiding Palestinian refugees, with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warning of severe humanitarian consequences. The strike in Beit Lahiya is among the deadliest in recent weeks, with high casualties reported.

While the US supports Israel, it is starting to find fatigue in this support. The US had to tell Israel to ensure aid gets to Gaza or [lose funding](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-tells-israel-boost-gaza-humanitarian-aid-or-risk-weapons-money/) a couple of weeks ago. Support for military assistance for Israel is dropping. Less would like the US to take as much direct action in assisting Israel. ¬† Israel is one of the top issues dividing progressives at the moment. Some people view Harris as too [supportive](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/arab-american-voters-struggle-to-back-harris-over-u-s-support-for-israels-war-in-gaza) of Israel, while others see her as an anti-Israel candidate. Although the US will likely always advocate for Israel, some policies could change if she is elected.

### Canada-India tensions

![Canada accuses India's Home Minister Amit Shah of targeting Sikh activists, heightening diplomatic tensions](/images/canada-claims-indian-minister-plotted-to-target-sikh-separatists-UyNz.webp)

Canada has accused Indian Home Minister Amit Shah of being behind a campaign [targeting Sikh activists](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/30/canada-accuses-indias-amit-shah-over-campaign-targeting-sikh-separatists), which has reportedly led to violence and even the assassination of [Hardeep Singh Nijjar](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66860510). Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister David Morrison confirmed this assertion during a national security committee meeting, highlighting Shah‚Äôs significant role in the alleged actions against Sikh separatists in Canada. Although India has yet to respond to these specific allegations, sources within the Indian government have labeled Canada‚Äôs claims as ‚Äúflimsy.‚Äù

This ongoing dispute has escalated tensions between the two countries, resulting in reciprocal expulsions of diplomats. The Canadian government has previously asserted it possesses credible evidence linking Indian agents to Nijjar‚Äôs murder in British Columbia. Additionally, the United States has charged a former [Indian intelligence officer](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2949p14k4o) for allegedly plotting to murder another Sikh activist in New York City.

### Hungary-Russia ties

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto will attend the [Minsk Conference on Eurasian Security](https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-peter-szijjarto-join-russia-syria-belarus-security-summit/), joining Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Syrian Foreign Minister Bassam Sabbagh. The conference, promoted by the Russia-aligned CSTO, is positioned as an alternative to the [Munich Security Conference](https://securityconference.org/en/about-us/about-the-msc/) and reflects Hungary‚Äôs deepening ties with Russia and Belarus.¬†

Szijjarto‚Äôs participation highlights Hungary‚Äôs divergent stance within NATO, especially its ongoing cooperation with Moscow on energy and diplomatic fronts. Hungary has also been under scrutiny this week regarding Hungarian-Russian relations as PM Victor Orban made a visit to Tbilisi after the [controversial election](https://www.tbsnews.net/worldbiz/europe/georgias-election-fears-war-russia-overshadow-eu-hopes-voters-980011) to congregate the Pro Russia Georgian Dream party and received massive boos [(watch video) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdZktmTCDEc)from protestors.¬†

**üá∫üá¶ Ukraine:** Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in [Iceland](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-updates-zelenskyy-meets-with-nordic-leaders/live-70624676) for the fourth Ukraine-Northern Europe Summit, marking his first official visit. He met with the prime ministers of Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland to discuss support for [Ukraine‚Äôs five-step victory plan](https://www.politico.eu/article/volodymyr-zelenskyy-presents-his-victory-plan-to-ukraine-parliament-war-vladimir-putin/), including financing for weapons production and enhancing maritime security. Zelensky met with Icelandic parliamentary leaders and participated in a session of the [Nordic Council](https://www.norden.org/en/news/volodymyr-zelenskyy-address-session-nordic-council), building on his previous attendance at the summit in Stockholm in May.

**üá¨üá™ Georgia:** Georgia‚Äôs election commission [announced plans](https://www.dw.com/en/georgia-announces-partial-vote-recount-amid-protests/a-70631594) to recount votes from randomly selected polling stations after the recent [parliamentary elections](https://civil.ge/archives/631310) sparked allegations of fraud. The ruling Georgian Dream party secured nearly 54% of the votes, while opposition alliances garnered under 38%. [Protests](https://apnews.com/article/georgia-election-russia-european-union-protests-f6667dd64b537bd2082bfc5396f4a955) erupted in Tbilisi, with opposition leaders and President Salome Zourabichvili claiming the election was rigged. Zourabichvili expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of the recount and called for an international investigation into the election results.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is the difference between an expat and an immigrant?**

![Passport placed on a map](/images/what-is-the-difference-between-an--expat--and---immigrant--Y3OD.webp)

The ‚Äúexpat‚Äù and ‚Äúimmigrant‚Äù are often used interchangeably but have distinct connotations. Expat (Expatriate) typically refers to someone living temporarily or semi-permanently in a foreign country, often due to work or lifestyle choices. ‚ÄúExpat‚Äù often implies an intention to return to their home country eventually. An Immigrant moves to another country intending to settle there permanently, often seeking long-term residency or citizenship.

While both involve living abroad, ‚Äúexpat‚Äù generally suggests temporary residence, whereas ‚Äúimmigrant‚Äù implies a permanent relocation. Social and economic factors can also influence which terms people use. Often, the difference between the two is rooted in classism. Those from North America, Australia, or Europe are labeled expats, and those from other places are labeled immigrants. But this is incorrect; the differences are related to the duration and intention.
