President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping [met](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/16/politics/joe-biden-xi-jinping-donald-trump/index.html) on the sidelines of the [APEC summit](https://apnews.com/article/peru-apec-biden-xi-china-trump-trade-c9883061b53ab82f5630a3bd6fcf87fa) in Lima for their final encounter, reflecting on a decade-long diplomatic relationship marked by candid exchanges and strategic challenges. As Biden prepares to leave office and Donald Trump assumes the presidency, the meeting dealt with the looming global uncertainty about future U.S.-China relations. The leaders addressed contentious issues, including Taiwan, Ukraine, and trade, while reaffirming the importance of clear communication to manage their nations‚Äô complex relationships.

Xi Jinping [pledged to work](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2l4dn802lo) with incoming President Donald Trump but delivered a strong message about China‚Äôs priorities. Xi warned against a ‚Äúnew Cold War,‚Äù and containing China would be unwise, unacceptable, and destined to fail. He stressed that a stable U.S.-China relationship is crucial for both nations and the world.

### Iran denies Musk talks

![Iran denies reports of UN ambassador meeting with Elon Musk](/images/the-ayotollah-might-be-dying-Q4NT.webp)

Iran‚Äôs foreign ministry has [denied reports](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/16/middleeast/iran-denies-musk-meeting-intl/index.html) of a meeting between the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, and Elon Musk, following coverage in U.S. media. Despite reports from The New York Times and the Associated Press, which cited Iranian and U.S. officials, Iran‚Äôs spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei ‚Äúcategorically denied‚Äù the meeting, expressing surprise at the media coverage.¬†

The alleged meeting, which was said to have lasted over an hour and focused on defusing tensions between the U.S. and Iran, occurred in New York earlier this week. The reports questioned Musk‚Äôs [influence](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/examining-elon-musk-influence-on-trump-transition/) on U.S. foreign policy under President-elect Donald Trump. Musk, a close ally of Trump, is also slated to lead a new ‚Äú[Department of Government Efficiency](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqd4vw0ejeo)‚Äù in Trump‚Äôs second administration. However, the structure and function of the department remain unclear.

### Troubles in Abkhazia

Abkhazia, Georgia‚Äôs Russia-backed breakaway region, is in a political crisis as protesters [stormed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/15/protesters-storm-parliament-in-breakaway-georgian-region-of-abkhazia) government buildings in its capital, Sukhumi. The protestors oppose a controversial deal allowing Russians to buy land. Concerns about rising property prices and increasing Russian influence have fueled the unrest. Protesters have refused to leave despite President Aslan Bzhania's [offering to resign](https://www.dw.com/en/abkhazia-leader-ready-to-quit-if-protesters-exit-parliament/a-70802086) and call snap elections if they vacate the premises.

Opposition leaders demand Bzhania‚Äôs unconditional resignation, accusing him of exploiting ties with Moscow for personal gain. While they do not oppose close relations with Russia, they claim the deal risks eroding local control and sovereignty. Abkhazia, which broke from Georgia in 1993 and is recognized only by Russia and a few allies, remains economically and militarily dependent on Moscow. The protests, which disrupted a legislative session, underscore deep frustrations with Russia's presence. Trust in Russia among Abkhaz has dramatically reached a low point.¬†¬†

**üá´üá∑ France**: Marine Le Pen, leader of France's far-right National Rally (RN), [risks disqualification](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20241115-would-banning-marine-le-pen-running-president-be-gift-for-france-far-right-national-rally) from the 2027 presidential race if convicted of embezzling EU funds for parliamentary assistants. Along with a ‚Ç¨300,000 fine and possible prison time, she faces a five-year ban from public office, potentially benefiting her prot√©g√©, Jordan Bardella. At 29, Bardella, RN president, positions himself as her successor and frames the trial as an example of ‚Äúanti-democratic‚Äù institutions. Critics claim the RN is milking the situation to fuel anti-establishment sentiment, exploiting growing public distrust in the EU and judiciary. While the trial threatens Le Pen‚Äôs future, the RN's rising popularity indicates the party could capitalize on France's dissatisfaction with traditional politics.

**üá∫üá¶ Ukraine:** Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy [criticized](https://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-scholz-call-vladimir-putin-open-pandoras-box-volodymyr-zelenskyy/) German Chancellor Olaf Scholz‚Äôs recent phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, describing it as a ‚ÄúPandora‚Äôs box‚Äù that undermines global efforts to isolate Moscow. Scholz urged Putin to withdraw troops and negotiate a ‚Äújust and lasting peace,‚Äù marking their first conversation in nearly two years. While Scholz informed Zelenskyy of the call beforehand, the Ukrainian leader expressed concerns that such dialogues weaken Russia‚Äôs isolation, which he claims is vital to ending the war. Scholz has balanced supporting Ukraine with military aid while advocating for diplomacy to prevent escalation.¬†

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why does Russia have Kaliningrad?**

![](/images/kaliningrad--I5NT.webp)

Russia has Kaliningrad as a result of post-World War II territorial adjustments. Formerly known as Konigsberg, it was part of Germany‚Äôs East Prussia. After the war, the Soviet Union annexed the area under the [1945 Potsdam Agreement](https://www.britannica.com/event/Potsdam-Conference). It was renamed Kaliningrad and became a strategically significant exclave for Russia, providing an essential port on the Baltic Sea and a military outpost in Europe. The territory remains [geographically separated](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kaliningrad,+Kaliningrad+Oblast,+Russia/@54.6136452,20.5900888,8.61z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x46e33d8d4b7c21a9:0x5050960016126ed3!8m2!3d54.7104264!4d20.4522144!16zL20vMDQ5aHc?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) from mainland Russia, bordered by Poland and Lithuania.

Russia‚Äôs historical ties to Kaliningrad are limited compared to other parts of its territory. The region, formerly known as Konigsberg, was primarily part of Germanic states for centuries, including the Teutonic Order and later Prussia, before becoming part of Germany. K√∂nigsberg was a major cultural and intellectual center for the German-speaking world and had no direct Russian governance until World War II. Russia‚Äôs connections to this in the modern day are simply strategic and a prize for being on the winning side of the war.
