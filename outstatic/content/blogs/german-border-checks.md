### Germany Puts Border Checks on All Land Borders

The German government has announced that it will conduct checks at all its land borders. The checks are part of Germany’s recent plan to limit [irregular migration](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-extends-temporary-controls-to-all-land-borders/a-70171255) and address threats from cross-border criminal organizations. The controls will start the following Monday and last for six months. With borders shared with nine neighboring countries, including Poland, France, and Austria, these checks are expected to cause significant delays for travelers, disrupting daily commutes and transport routes.

As a [Schengen Area member](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-area_en), Germany usually operates under the open-border agreement that allows free movement across participating countries. However, Schengen rules allow for temporary border checks during exceptional situations. Austria has implemented similar measures since 2015. Germany’s new controls, although permitted, have raised concerns among some that this could set a precedent for other countries, threatening the principles of the Schengen Agreement.

Critics argue that these checks may not effectively reduce illegal migration and could instead be viewed as a response to public fears. However, German officials emphasize that the measure is necessary for maintaining security and stability.

### China and Russia to Have Joint Military Exercises

China announced it will conduct military exercises with Russia this month. The two nations will undergo joint naval and air drills in the Sea of Japan and Okhotsk. These exercises aim to improve [strategic cooperation ](https://apnews.com/article/china-russia-drills-military-pacific-72ece848adec1684326f12b6d03183fe)between the two countries and help them deal with common security threats.

While China has officially maintained a neutral stance on the conflict in Ukraine, its growing cooperation with Russia, especially as the war intensifies, is likely to upset Ukraine and its Western allies, including the U.S. and the EU.

### Kim Jong Un Wants to Boost North Korea’s Nuclear Arsenal

On Monday, which was the founding day of North Korea, Kim Jong Un announced that he would like to implement a nuclear construction policy that increases the number of nuclear weapons “exponentially” in North Korea. He believes this is essential to counter [US threats](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-says-country-increase-number-nuclear-weapons-kcna-says-2024-09-09/). Japanese, South Korean, and American counterparts did not take this announcement well.

The three recently met in Seoul to reaffirm their trilateral cooperation. The US and South Korea also had joint military exercises last month. The announcement could be retaliation for this and boost enthusiasm among North Koreans. North Korea recently suffered major floods, which caused a lot of destruction. Kim Jong Un allegedly executed some officials over the floods, per [North Korean](https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/southeast-asia/north-korea-kim-jong-un-executes-officials-floods-b2606762.html) state media.

### Jordanian Elections Clouded by Gaza

On Tuesday, Jordanians cast their votes in [parliamentary elections](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/10/jordan-elections-how-will-electoral-reforms-impact-the-september-10-polls), the first since constitutional reforms and new election laws were enacted in 2022. These amendments aim to enhance democracy and increase the role of political parties in Jordan’s governance. Despite these changes, voter turnout remained low, continuing the trend from previous elections.

Many Jordanians are dissatisfied with their government’s stance on the [Gaza conflict](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/21/tightrope-jordans-balancing-act-between-iran-and-israel). While Jordan maintains a strong alliance with Israel and good relations with the broader Middle East, criticism is mounting over its handling of Gaza and the treatment of Jordanian-Palestinians. These issues have overshadowed the elections, leaving many citizens feeling disengaged from the political process.

### Venezuelan Opposition Candidate Vows to Fight for Democracy

While exiled in Spain, Venezuela’s opposition candidate Emundo Gonzales said this is not the end; he will continue to fight for democracy. He was given asylum in Spain because the situation in Venezuela was too dangerous for him to remain. An [arrest warrant](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c623yqdn7eeo) is out for him.

Though some suggest his flight may boost President Maduro's image by portraying Gonzales as having "run away," his exile has drawn attention to Venezuela's political crisis. His presence in Spain has also raised awareness within the EU, potentially elevating the urgency for international action on Venezuela’s situation.
