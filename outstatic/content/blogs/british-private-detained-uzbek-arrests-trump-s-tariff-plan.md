### British private captured

![](/images/british-man-captured-by-russian-forces-while-fighting-for-ukraine-in-kursk-region-YxMj.webp)

James Scott Rhys Anderson, a 22-year-old British national, has reportedly been [captured](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rl6jp78dyo) by Russian forces while fighting for Ukraine. In a [video](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6365177727112) shared online, Anderson, a former British Army private, explained he joined Ukraine‚Äôs International Legion after losing his job and being inspired by war reports. Russian state media claims Anderson was detained in the contested [Kursk region](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kursk+Oblast,+Russia/@51.6677647,34.9800862,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x412f0579d6594437:0xad02dfc2bf4338a8!8m2!3d51.7634026!4d35.3811812!16zL20vMDJmbmgx?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTEyNC4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) amid heavy fighting. Ukraine has reportedly lost over [40%](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241123-ukraine-loses-more-than-40-of-territory-it-seized-in-russia-s-kursk-region) of the territory it captured in Russia‚Äôs Kursk region during a surprise August offensive, according to a senior Ukrainian military source.¬†

Anderson‚Äôs father expressed fear for his son‚Äôs safety, citing concerns about potential torture. The UK Foreign Office confirmed its support for Anderson‚Äôs family, while the Foreign Secretary pledged to assist. Russia often labels foreign fighters as ‚Äúmercenaries,‚Äù denying them legal protections under the [Geneva Conventions](https://www.britannica.com/event/Geneva-Conventions). Anderson‚Äôs capture highlights the risks international volunteers face and raises questions about the treatment of detainees.¬†

### UAE arrests Uzbeks

The United Arab Emirates has [arrested](https://apnews.com/article/uae-israel-rabbi-killed-arrests-e4e2d0f54fd81d8f7693605639a594bd) three Uzbek nationals for the killing of [Rabbi Zvi Kogan](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy4j5j7503o), an Israeli-Moldovan citizen, in Dubai. Kogan, 28, managed a kosher grocery store and was a prominent figure in the UAE's burgeoning Israeli community. Authorities have not disclosed a motive but suggested he was killed due to his identity as an [ultra-Orthodox Jew](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ultra-Orthodox-Judaism).

The incident comes amid heightened regional tensions following the October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel and Israel‚Äôs subsequent military responses. While Emirati-Israeli ties forged under the [Abraham Accords](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Abraham-Accords) have endured, concerns about security for Jewish and Israeli residents in the UAE have grown. Israeli and Emirati officials are collaborating in the investigation, with the UAE affirming its commitment to tolerance and security. Uzbekistan also has seen a rise in anti-Semitism, which is nothing new; many of the Soviet Jews who immigrated to Israel were from Uzbekistan.¬†

### Tariff punch

President-elect Donald Trump has announced plans to impose [sweeping tariffs](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241126-trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-china) on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China. He pledged to sign executive orders imposing a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada and a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, citing concerns over fentanyl smuggling and immigration. Posting on Truth Social, Trump emphasized national security as the justification, echoing his first-term trade policies that saw [tariffs](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/27/trump-tariffs-explained) on Chinese goods and renegotiating the [USMCA trade agreement](https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement).¬†

Trump‚Äôs incoming commerce secretary, [Howard Lutnick](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/19/politics/howard-lutnick-commerce-secretary/index.html), supports even higher tariffs on Chinese products. Economists warn these measures could raise consumer prices and slow economic growth. Critics argue that leveraging national security for trade barriers risks undermining global trade norms. Mexico‚Äôs President Claudia Sheinbaum dismissed the threat as ‚Äúno cause for concern,‚Äù while experts predict retaliatory moves from affected trading partners. Legal challenges to the tariffs are also anticipated.

**üáÆüá± Israel:** The ceasefire agreement between Israel and [Hezbollah](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah), brokered by the U.S. with French support, is a significant step towards [ending the conflict](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/26/biden-announces-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-agreement). It includes deploying 5,000 Lebanese Army troops to the south and enhanced UN peacekeeper oversight to restore stability and allow displaced residents to return home. U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron stressed the need to prevent further violence while addressing Lebanon‚Äôs security and sovereignty. This ceasefire brings hope for recovery in Lebanon and demonstrates the potential of international diplomacy in resolving regional disputes.

**üá©üá™ Germany:** Germany‚Äôs Social Democratic Party [(SPD) ](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Social-Democratic-Party-of-Germany)has nominated Chancellor [Olaf Scholz](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-spd-nominates-scholz-as-chancellor-candidate/a-70875174) as its lead candidate for the snap federal election on February 23. Scholz secured unanimous backing from senior SPD members after Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, currently the most famous German politician, declined to run and endorsed Scholz. Scholz faces significant challenges as Germany‚Äôs least popular chancellor since reunification, with the SPD polling at 14%, trailing the [CDU-CSU](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christian-Democratic-Union-political-party-Germany) at 32% and the far-right [AfD](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Alternative-for-Germany) at 19%. The SPD‚Äôs campaign has been marred by internal discord following the collapse of the [‚Äútraffic light‚Äù coalition](https://www.ips-journal.eu/topics/democracy-and-society/collapse-by-numbers-7922/), which included the Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP).

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why is the situation in Myanmar tense?**

![](/images/myanmar-Y3OT.webp)

The situation in Myanmar is tense due to ongoing conflict between the military junta, which seized power in a [2021 coup](https://www.britannica.com/event/2021-Myanmar-coup-d-etat), and pro-democracy forces, including ethnic armed groups and resistance movements. The coup put a stop to a decade of democratic progress. It sparked widespread protests that were brutally suppressed, leading to thousands of civilian deaths and arrests. [Ethnic tensions](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/rohingya-crisis), a long-standing issue in Myanmar, have further escalated as various groups push back against military control, creating a very multifaced conflict. International sanctions have isolated the junta but didn‚Äôt end the violence, while humanitarian conditions worsened due to displacement, economic collapse, and restricted aid access.

This volatile mix of political unrest, ethnic strife, and humanitarian crises has kept Myanmar in a state of turmoil with no clear resolution in sight. China significantly influences Myanmar and could play a role in stabilizing the situation. Still, its involvement is complex and often driven by self-interest, mainly because of the Bay of Bengal. It wants a thumb in the greater Southeast Asian region. It could put some potential pressure on the country or be a potential broker, but even this is a bit optimistic. It likely wouldn‚Äôt be in China‚Äôs interest if Myanmar returned to democracy.¬†
