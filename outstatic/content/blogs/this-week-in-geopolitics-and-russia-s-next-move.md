### THIS WEEK IN GEOPOLITICS

**üá®üá≥ Biden and Xi's final talks:** President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping [met](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/16/politics/joe-biden-xi-jinping-donald-trump/index.html) at the [APEC summit](https://apnews.com/article/peru-apec-biden-xi-china-trump-trade-c9883061b53ab82f5630a3bd6fcf87fa) in Lima for their final discussion, reflecting on a decade of diplomatic relations. As Biden prepares to leave office and Donald Trump takes over, they addressed critical issues like Taiwan, Ukraine, and trade, emphasizing the need for clear communication. Xi [stressed](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2l4dn802lo) the importance of a stable U.S.-China relationship and warned that attempts to contain China would be unwise and destined to fail.

**üá¨üá™ Abkhaz political turmoil:** Abkhazia‚Äôs president, Aslan Bzhania, [resigned](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241119-abkhazia-moscow-president-protesters) on Tuesday after reaching an agreement with demonstrators who protested against a proposed investment deal with Russia. The [protests](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241115-protesters-in-georgia-s-breakaway-region-abkhazia-storm-parliament-over-russian-investment-measure) in Sukhumi reflected fears that the deal could alter the region‚Äôs character. Demonstrators blocked roads and occupied government buildings, demanding Bzhania‚Äôs resignation. He cited the need for stability and constitutional order in his resignation letter. The protesters vacated government premises, and Bzhania‚Äôs deputy will serve as acting president. [Abkhazia](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18175030), recognized as part of Georgia, has been under de facto Russian control since the [2008 Russia-Georgia war](https://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/13/world/europe/2008-georgia-russia-conflict/index.html).

**üá∫üá¶ Biden permits long-range strikes:** President Joe Biden has [authorized](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241117-us-for-the-first-time-authorises-ukraine-s-use-of-long-range-missiles-inside-russia) Ukraine to strike Russian territory using U.S.-supplied long-range [ATACMS](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/18/atacms-missiles-what-are-they-why-they-important-for-ukraine) missiles, a decision aimed at further supporting Kyiv amid North Korea's deployment of [10,000 troops](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/russia-north-korean-troops-ukraine-war) to assist Russia. Washington had previously hesitated due to concerns over U.S. munitions depletion and potential conflict escalation. This policy shift comes as Biden prepares to hand over power to President-elect Donald Trump, who intends to negotiate peace. The move may prompt European allies, including Germany, to reconsider their stances, although Germany remains cautious about supplying Taurus missiles.

**üá≠üá∞ Hong Kong 47:** The sentencing of [Hong Kong 47](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/19/hong-kong-democracy-activists-jailed-who-are-they-whats-the-case-about), a group of pro-democracy activists, has drawn global criticism. Charged under Beijing‚Äôs national security law for organizing unofficial primary elections in 2020, sentences ranged from a few years to 10, with legal scholar Benny Tai receiving the harshest punishment. [Critics](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/international-outrage-sentencing-pro-democracy-activists-hong-kong) claim the law, imposed after the 2019 protests, silences dissent and tightens Beijing's control over Hong Kong. Many view the sentences as politically motivated, undermining fundamental freedoms and democracy. This case highlights the deterioration of Hong Kong's autonomy under the ‚Äúone country, two systems‚Äù framework and sets a worrying precedent for severe penalties for peaceful political engagement.

**Kyiv embassy closures:** The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has [temporarily closed](https://www.newsweek.com/us-embassy-kyiv-closes-attack-threat-russia-ukraine-war-latest-1988714) due to intelligence about a potential Russian airstrike. Embassy personnel are sheltering in place, and U.S. citizens in Ukraine are advised to stay informed and find nearby shelters. Other European nations, including Italy and Spain, have closed their embassies. This closure follows the U.S. [approval](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241119-us-approval-for-ukraine-missile-strikes-into-russia-is-a-slim-lifeline-for-kyiv-1) for Ukraine to use American weaponry against Russia, prompting Moscow to escalate its rhetoric and revise its [nuclear doctrine.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4v0rey0jzo) Reports show intensified Russian missile and drone strikes across Ukraine, leading to civilian casualties and targeting critical infrastructure, such as a recent attack in Sumy.

### THE BIG QUESTION

**How far will Russia go after US missile use?**

This week, Joe Biden gave Ukraine the right to use American long-range missiles‚Äîthis, of course, angers Russia, which has already retaliated. Putin promptly [lowered](https://apnews.com/article/russia-nuclear-doctrine-putin-91f20e0c9b0f9e5eaa3ed97c35789898) the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, permitting retaliation against conventional attacks from nations supported by nuclear powers in his nuclear doctrine. Strikes in Ukraine have taken a more brutal toll this week, which resulted in [embassy closures](https://www.newsweek.com/us-embassy-kyiv-closes-attack-threat-russia-ukraine-war-latest-1988714) in Kyiv. Russia has [ballistic missiles](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-missiles-kyiv-claims-icbm-dnipro-after-atacams-strike/) and has already used them as well.¬†

As for the long term, it remains to be seen. But it will likely continue the pattern it has been taking for the last 1000 days. Russia could recruit [Northern Korean troops](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/08/ukrainians-ready-for-north-korean-troops-russia-war) who are mostly going to die at the front due to a lack of expertise, experience, and language barriers. Russia‚Äôs [vulnerable minorities](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/russias-ethnic-minorities-disproportionately-conscripted-to-fight-the-war-in-ukraine) will continue to be conscripted at higher rates than ethnic Russians.¬†

However, the retaliations could backfire as parties such as China and Iran might be more hesitant to be an active part in Russia‚Äôs war with Ukraine. Iran, who gave them ballistic missiles, is engaged in a proxy war with Israel and has received little help in return from Russia. China is calling for a [ceasefire](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ukraine-russia-war-early-ceasefire-chinas-peace-call-for-ukraine-after-us-okays-strikes-on-russia-7046543).¬†

So, Russia will likely not gain new participants to amp up retaliation efforts against Ukraine‚Äôs long-range missiles. On the subject of whether Russia will retaliate against the US and Europe, while uncertain, it might not be as likely as the war in Ukraine has posed too big a challenge. With the lack of enthusiastic participants, striking a member already in the NATO club might be too daunting.¬†

### TODAY AGO

On this day in 2011, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, after ruling for over three decades, signed a Gulf Cooperation Council ([GCC](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Gulf-Cooperation-Council)) agreement to transfer power to Vice President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The decision came amidst massive [Arab Spring](https://www.britannica.com/event/Arab-Spring) protests demanding his resignation, marking a pivotal moment in Yemen's political history and a rare instance of a negotiated leadership transition during the regional uprisings.
