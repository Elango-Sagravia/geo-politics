In 2018, a data privacy scandal involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica shook the tech industry and raised global awareness about the handling of personal information online. This incident marked a turning point in the debate over data protection, revealing the dangers of mishandling user data and the potential for widespread misuse.

Cambridge Analytica, a British data analytics firm, gained unauthorized access to the personal data of millions of Facebook users. The company used a third-party app designed for personality quizzes to collect data from users and, crucially, from their friends—without explicit consent. In total, data from around 87 million users was harvested. This data breach highlighted serious concerns about how personal information could be exploited for political purposes and exposed vulnerabilities in Facebook’s data protection policies.

The revelation of this breach was a wake-up call for many social media users. Cambridge Analytica allegedly used the harvested data to influence political campaigns, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the Brexit referendum. By analyzing personal information, the company created targeted political ads, manipulating voters' perceptions and behavior. This misuse of data sparked outrage and raised serious ethical questions about the role of social media in democratic processes.

As news of the scandal spread, public trust in Facebook plummeted. Millions of users adjusted their privacy settings, with many deactivating or deleting their accounts entirely. Surveys indicated that 74% of Facebook users took some form of action in response to the breach. The scandal also intensified scrutiny of Facebook’s practices, with regulators and lawmakers demanding answers from the company. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, was called to testify before the U.S. Congress and the European Parliament, where he apologized and promised to do better.

The fallout from the scandal was immense. Facebook's stock price dropped by 18% in just one week, and the company faced a $5 billion fine from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for its role in the data breach. Beyond the financial penalties, the scandal prompted a global reassessment of data protection standards. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect in May 2018, imposing stricter requirements on how companies handle personal data and giving users more control over their information.

In the aftermath, Facebook introduced several changes to improve its data security and prevent similar incidents in the future. The company has implemented stricter policies on third-party apps, improved transparency in data handling, and enhanced user privacy controls. Despite these efforts, the scandal has left a lasting impact on Facebook's reputation and the broader tech industry.
