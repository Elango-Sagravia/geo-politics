### Putinâ€™s offer

![Fighting in Ukraine reaches day 105](/images/flighting-in-ukraine-is-now-at-day-105-QxND.jpg)

Russian President Vladimir Putin has [signed](https://www.dw.com/en/russia-offers-debt-relief-to-recruits-for-ukraine-war/a-70868761) a law allowing debt forgiveness for recruits who sign one-year contracts to fight in Ukraine. Eligible recruits with debts of up to 10 million roubles (â‚¬92,000, $95,835) and debt collection proceedings initiated before December 1 can benefit, though the law excludes those already enlisted. Recently, he had a similar law that allowed those enlisting to avoid [criminal charges](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-law-defendants-pressure-join-military/33144788.html).

This shows Russiaâ€™s struggles to replenish troop levels as the war continues after [1000 days](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/25/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1005). NATO recently estimated over 600,000 Russian casualties since February 2022, emphasizing the toll on manpower. Russia has relied on incentives like significant cash payouts to avoid another general mobilization. These efforts coincide with reports of foreign troops, including North Koreans, bolstering Russian ranks. As battlefield losses mount, the Kremlin appears increasingly desperate to maintain its forces.

### Romaniaâ€™s surprise

![](/images/romanian-election-IzMz.webp)

Ultranationalist Calin Georgescu, a far-right and pro-Russia candidate, has [shocked ](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dlw5pq967o)Romania by leading the first round of the presidential election with 23% of the vote. Georgescu, who ran independently and campaigned primarily on TikTok, was initially polling at just 5%. The second-place battle is close, with center-right Save Romania Union candidate Elena Lasconi narrowly edging out Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, the pre-election favorite, by around 2,000 votes.

Ciolacu, who resigned as Social Democrat leader following his poor showing, now leaves the December 8 runoff likely between Georgescu and Lasconi. Georgescu, known for opposing NATOâ€™s missile defense in Romania and his nationalist rhetoric, gained support from George Simionâ€™s AUR party. The election has exposed divisions, as Social Democrat voters may struggle to back the progressive Lasconi in the final round, while economic woes and refugee policies influenced the campaign.â€‹

### Thousands march on Karachi

Thousands of supporters of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan [defied](https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-lockdown-imran-khan-rally-clashes-belarus-ec6cb96753c83be24b20cd32588ead71) heavy police resistance, lockdown measures, and widespread arrests to march toward Islamabad, demanding his release. Clashes with authorities left one police officer dead and several others injured, while tear gas and roadblocks failed to deter the protesters.

Khanâ€™s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party led the march, with his wife, Bushra Bibi, addressing crowds 30 miles from the capital. Protesters vowed to overcome obstacles, including police barricades, to reach their goal.

[Khan](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-19844270), jailed since August 2023, faces over 150 criminal cases, which his party claims are politically motivated. The march coincided with a visit by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, further intensifying tensions. The government criticized the demonstrations for harming Pakistanâ€™s fragile economy, with analysts warning of significant financial losses.

**ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ UK:** The International Criminal Court (ICC) has [issued](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr4gvydxeno) arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes in Gaza. ICC member states, including the UK, must comply with these warrants under international law. Downing Street has confirmed that the UK will fulfill its legal obligations if Netanyahu enters the country. The warrants raise significant questions about Israelâ€™s global standing and international law enforcement. While the US and Israel have condemned the warrants, some [European](https://www.politico.eu/article/benjamin-netanyahu-arrest-warrant-war-crimes-gaza-travel-arrest-europe/) nations support the ICCâ€™s independence, stressing the need for justice without equating actions by Israel and Hamas.

**ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ Taiwan:** Taiwan has [detected](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-reports-chinese-balloon-first-time-six-months-2024-11-25/) a Chinese balloon off its northern coast, the first incident since April. Spotted near Keelung port at 33,000 feet, the balloon disappeared after two hours without entering Taiwanese airspace, according to Taiwan's Ministry of Defense. This event occurs amid rising tensions as Taiwan approaches its January presidential election. Taipei has accused Beijing of using "grey-zone warfare," such as balloon surveillance, to intimidate Taiwan. China, which claims these balloons serve meteorological purposes, has denied allegations of espionage. The issue gained attention last year when the U.S. shot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon, with Beijing dismissing it as a mischaracterization.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Which countries have nuclear weapons?**

![](/images/countries-that-have-nuclear-weapons-Q0NT.webp)

Nine countries possess nuclear weapons for security, deterrence, and influence. The [NPT](https://disarmament.unoda.org/wmd/nuclear/npt/) recognizes five nuclear states: the U.S., Russia, China, France, and the UK. These nations developed arsenals during World War II and the Cold War to deter aggression, maintain power, and safeguard allies. The U.S. and Russia lead with the largest arsenals, prioritizing global dominance.

Outside the NPT, India and Pakistan pursued weapons to counter regional rivals, while Israel (undeclared) maintains nuclear ambiguity for existential security. North Korea developed nuclear weapons for regime survival and deterrence.

Countries develop nuclear weapons to deter threats, ensure strategic independence, and assert status, particularly in volatile regions. Global efforts like the NPT, [CTBT](https://www.ctbto.org/our-mission/the-treaty), and bilateral treaties like [START](https://www.britannica.com/event/Strategic-Arms-Reduction-Talks) aim to limit proliferation. Still, disarmament remains challenging due to geopolitical tensions and reliance on nuclear arsenals for national security. Nuclear weapons continue to symbolize power and protection.â€‹
