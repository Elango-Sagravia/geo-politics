### New world disorder

Global leaders responded differently to Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential victory. Leaders like India‚Äôs Narendra [Modi](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/world/pm-modi-congratulates-donald-trump-on-us-election-victory-says-looking-forward-to-renewing-collaboration/article68836645.ece) and Hungary‚Äôs Viktor [Orban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-1vKzOYWe8) celebrated Trump's return, emphasizing the potential for stronger alliances. Meanwhile, European figures such as Ursula [von der Leyen](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_24_5701) and Olaf [Scholz](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/were-better-off-together-german-chancellor-tells-donald-trump-6957957) expressed cautious optimism, hoping for constructive cooperation between the U.S. and the EU. They expressed hope for constructive dialogue and partnership between the United States and the European Union, particularly in addressing shared challenges.

Leaders like Israel's [Netanyahu](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-827780) in the Middle East expressed enthusiasm for a renewed regional stability and security focus. Ukraine's President [Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2024/nov/07/volodymyr-zelenskyy-congratulates-donald-trump-on-election-victory-video) welcomed Trump's support for a "peace through strength" policy. On the other hand, [Russia's response](https://www.politico.eu/article/vladimir-putin-not-planning-congratulate-donald-trump-election-victory-kremlin-us-russia-relations/) was notably reserved, reflecting the complex geopolitical tensions between the two nations. This cautious stance suggests that while some leaders may hope for improved relations, underlying issues are causing the strained U.S.-Russia dynamic to remain unresolved.

### Ukraine vs North Korea

Ukraine has reportedly [encountered](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-clashed-north-korean-troops-first-time-minister-says-rustem-umerov-moscow/) North Korean soldiers fighting alongside Russian forces, marking the first confirmed clashes between Ukrainian and North Korean troops, according to Ukraine‚Äôs defense minister, Rustem Umerov. The Pentagon reported that over [10,000 North Korean soldiers](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3955757/pentagon-says-10k-north-korean-troops-in-kursk-oblast/) are stationed in Russia‚Äôs [Kursk](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kursk,+Kursk+Oblast,+Russia/@51.712105,36.0173266,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x412f0375da12791b:0x9788ae489cd5e746!8m2!3d51.7482395!4d36.1947023!16zL20vMDNqbWI4?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAyOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) region to support Moscow‚Äôs invasion.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on Western allies to permit long-range missile strikes into Russian territory to counter this development [(see World‚Äôs inventory)](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/worldwide-ballistic-missile-inventories). This week, Russia and North Korea signed a new [defense pact](https://www.euronews.com/2024/11/06/russia-and-north-korea-sign-off-military-alliance-amid-pyongyang-troops-entering-the-fray), marking their strongest alliance since the Cold War. This agreement, signed by President Putin and Kim Jong Un in June and ratified by Russia‚Äôs Federation Council, mandates mutual military support if either nation faces an attack. South Korea is strongly [sending observers](https://www.reuters.com/world/south-koreas-yoon-trudeau-warn-over-north-korea-role-ukraine-war-yoons-office-2024-10-30/) to Ukraine in retaliation.

### Israel‚Äôs defense

![Israeli PM Netanyahu removes Defense Minister Gallant amid policy disputes](/images/israel-gets-a-new-defense-ministe-I4OD.webp)

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has [removed](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241105-%F0%9F%94%B4-israel-s-netanyahu-fires-defence-minister-gallant) Defense Minister Yoav Gallant after months of mounting disagreements over Israel‚Äôs domestic policies and war strategy. In a televised address, Netanyahu stated, "Trust between him and the minister of defense has cracked.‚Äù Gallant‚Äôs removal comes amid Israel‚Äôs active military conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon and heightened tensions with Iran [(latest updates)](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/11/6/live-protests-in-israel-after-gallants-sacking-attacks-continue-in-gaza). This reshuffle sees Israel Katz, the current foreign minister, stepping in as the new defense minister, while Gideon Sa‚Äôar will take over Katz‚Äôs role.

Gallant‚Äôs dismissal, however, has sparked widespread backlash and [public protests](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqj07jdzzgno), with thousands taking to the streets in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, accusing Netanyahu of jeopardizing Israel‚Äôs security for political gain. Families of hostages held in Gaza joined the demonstrations, accusing Netanyahu's decision of being a betrayal. Gallant, who has previously disagreed with Netanyahu on various issues, [criticized the government](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglxlj4m3v0o)‚Äôs approach to the hostages in Gaza.¬†

**üá≤üáø Mozambique:** Mozambique braces for [escalating unrest](https://www.dw.com/en/mozambique-election-result-fresh-opposition-protests/a-70692769) as post-election protests intensify against [President Daniel Chapo](https://www.dw.com/en/daniel-chapo-of-frelimo-wins-mozambique-election/a-70590971)‚Äôs victory. Opposition leader Ven√¢ncio Mondlane disputes the election results, citing fraud and government repression, while protests in Maputo are planned to peak in a significant rally on November 8. Analyst Fredson Guilengue warns that increased government force could worsen the situation as discontent grows over allegations of [FRELIMO](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Frelimo)‚Äôs election control. Limited internet access and disinformation further strain the country, with fears the crisis may deepen if grievances go unaddressed.

**üá≤üá≤ Myanmar:** Myanmar‚Äôs military leader, Min Aung Hlaing, recently [visited China](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yr8exg1gko) on his first trip there after [seizing power in 2021](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55882489). Facing setbacks in the civil war, his visit underscores China‚Äôs position as Myanmar‚Äôs leading regional partner, though it falls short of full endorsement from Beijing. China seeks stability and wants a clear election timeline from Myanmar‚Äôs junta to safeguard trade and investment. Meanwhile, opposition groups push for the end of [military rule](https://time.com/7160736/myanmar-coup-civil-war-conflict-timeline-endgame-explainer/). Still, China‚Äôs engagement highlights its commitment to mediating peace, given its influence and the limited impact of Western and regional diplomacy.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Where is Gaugazia?**

![Gagauzia, an autonomous region in Moldova, is home to the Russia-aligned Gagauz people](/images/gagauzia-20-g2Nz.webp)

[Gagauzia](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2022/walking-the-tightrope-towards-the-eu/4-gagauzia-the-restless-region-in-the-south/) is an autonomous territorial unit within Moldova located in the [southern part](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gagauzia,+Moldova/@45.9816179,27.9820593,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x40b703d0be565f6f:0xb77fa2c668497cc4!8m2!3d46.0979435!4d28.6384645!16zL20vMDIyaHY2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAyOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) of the country. This region is home to the [Gagauz people](https://minorityrights.org/communities/gagauz/), an ethnic group of Turkic origin who practice Orthodox Christianity and primarily speak Gagauz, Russian, and Romanian. Comrat is the capital and main administrative center.¬†

Gagauzia has been granted self-governing rights in cultural, economic, and regional matters. The region historically maintains close ties with Russia, occasionally shaping its political landscape and relationship with the Moldovan central government. It has a different status than [Transnistria](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18284837), which wants complete independence. The Gaugazs see themselves as different from the rest of Moldovans. They align more with [Russia](https://www.dw.com/en/moldovas-gagauzia-region-remains-largely-pro-russia/a-70658570) geopolitically than with the EU. 95% of the Gagauz voted against joining the European Union.¬†
