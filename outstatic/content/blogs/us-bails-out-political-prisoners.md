### US Secures Release of Nicaraguan Political Prisoners

U.S. officials have announced that they have successfully secured the [release](https://apnews.com/article/nicaragua-guatemala-prisoners-freed-7244a080da577a7992d55e2677630861) of 135 political prisoners in Nicaragua. The prisoners just arrived in Guatemala, where they intend to apply for entry into the U.S. and a few other countries. The Guatemalan government has given the nod to let them stay while they wait for their applications to be approved.

The prisoners were granted freedom based on humanitarian issues. US Officials say this doesn’t change any US policies on Nicaragua. Nicaragua continues to jail people for political dissent regularly. Human rights activists in Nicaragua have added that this is also only a minor victory, as the prisoners have to leave their countries to start lives somewhere totally different.

### China to End International Adoptions

China is going to put an end to its international [adoption](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/06/china/china-ends-foreign-adoptions-children-intl-hnk/index.html) programs. The Chinese foreign ministry says that no Chinese children will be sent anywhere abroad for adoption, with only a couple of exceptions for noncitizens adopting their blood children or stepchildren.

This puts a lot of families who have already started the process in legal limbo. More than 160,000 Chinese children have been adopted since 1992.

The Chinese government cites its declining birth rate as the primary reason for this decision. While not politically motivated, the move could strain relations between China and Western countries, particularly the U.S., which has been a major recipient of Chinese adoptees.

### Zelenskyy Visits US Air Base in Germany

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting with [officials](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-updates-zelenskyy-attends-ramstein-meeting/live-70148494) at the US military air base in Ramstein, Germany. His primary mission is to work with partners to strengthen Ukraine and get NATO members' approval for allowing it to use Western weapons to attack targets further across the Russian border. The US and Germany are also expected to increase military aid to Ukraine.

Ukraine, while not a member of NATO, is an aspiring member. Similarly to its quest to join the EU, it has a list of things it needs to resolve before being able to be a member and needs additional approval from each member state, which at this point would be impossible.

### UAE Pardons 57 Bangladeshi Protesters

The President of the UAE pardoned 57 Bangladeshi citizens for [protesting](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/3/uae-pardons-57-bangladeshis-jailed-for-anti-hasina-protests) the Bangladeshi government in the UAE. The prisoners were dealing with lengthy sentences for these protests; 3 of them were sentenced to life. The government said these protests were mirrored to the ones in Bangladesh and were causing riots and civil unrest, so that was why they were arrested. Political dissent in the UAE is a no-go.

Human rights groups criticized these arrests and called them arbitrary. Somehow, it worked, as the president pardoned and sent them home. The UAE is a major hub for guest workers from South Asia. Bangladeshis are the third biggest guest workers in the UAE after Indi and Pakistanis.

### Bangladesh Pressures India to Extradite Former PM

India is facing tremendous pressure from Bangladesh’s interim prime minister, Muhammed Yunis, to [extradite](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3277380/india-faces-pressure-bangladesh-extradite-sheikh-hasina-over-her-atrocities) the former PM Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh. He insisted that there would be no peace otherwise, and she needed to face trial for the atrocities that happened under her rule. India has yet to respond to this request.

Experts claim that India will unlikely grant this request. Relations between Bangladesh, the former PM, and India were strong when she was in power. However, there are sweeping accusations of anti-Hindu violence in Bangladesh, which doesn’t sit right with India. Bangladesh still needs a solid relationship with India anyway, even if she is not returned, so India has the upper hand.
