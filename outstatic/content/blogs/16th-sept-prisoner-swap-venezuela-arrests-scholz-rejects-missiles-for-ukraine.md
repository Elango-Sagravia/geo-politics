### Russia and Ukrainian Prisoner Swap

Russia and Ukraine have completed a prisoner swap involving 206 individuals, with 103 troops from each side being exchanged. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) brokered the deal, marking the second time this year they have facilitated such an agreement between the two warring nations. The Russian prisoners were captured during Ukraine’s [incursion into the Kursk region](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-putin-1178b99b32b476816db3a48ffa06b11a), while the Ukrainian soldiers were taken from various battlefronts. These swaps have become a lifeline for soldiers on both sides, providing relief amidst the brutal conflict.

Middle Eastern nations, including Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, have increasingly played neutral roles in facilitating these exchanges. Their relatively balanced relations with both Russia and Ukraine, as well as with Western powers, make them ideal mediators. These countries seek to maintain diplomatic ties with all parties involved, leveraging their influence to foster cooperation, despite the ongoing war.

While these prisoner swaps are a positive humanitarian gesture, they have done little to alter the course of the war. Russia continues its slow but steady advance in eastern Ukraine, and Ukraine is actively pushing Western allies, particularly the U.S., UK, and EU, to provide long-range missiles for use against Russian targets. However, some key allies, like [Germany](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-scholz-rules-out-long-range-weapons-for-ukraine/a-70219078), have already rejected the idea.

### Venezuela Arrests U.S., Spanish, and Czech Nationals Over Assassination Plot

Venezuelan authorities have arrested three U.S. citizens, two Spaniards, and a Czech national, accusing them of participating in a plot to assassinate President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. has denied any involvement, dismissing the accusations as fabricated. Neither Spain nor the Czech Republic has commented extensively on the arrests.

This development worsens already strained relations between Venezuela and the West. The U.S. has long refused to recognize [Maduro's government](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/29/venezuela-election-observers-urge-transparency-as-maduro-claims-victory), and Spain’s ties with Venezuela have been further complicated after granting [political asylum](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/08/americas/venezuela-opposition-candidate-gonzalez-spain-intl-hnk/index.html) to Venezuelan opposition leader Emundo Gonzales.

### German Chancellor Scholz Rejects Long-Range Missiles for Ukraine

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has ruled out providing Ukraine with long-range missiles, even if NATO allies decide to do so. Speaking in Brandenburg, Scholz emphasized the need to [avoid escalating the war](https://www.dw.com/en/german-chancellor-olaf-scholz-wants-swift-peace-in-ukraine/a-70215563) and reiterated Germany’s cautious approach toward Ukraine. He also stressed the importance of prosecuting those responsible for sabotaging the Nord Stream pipeline.

Scholz’s party faces pressure in upcoming state elections, with far-right parties like AFD and BSW, both skeptical of aiding Ukraine, gaining ground. Scholz’s decision comes amid ongoing criticism that Germany has been inconsistent in its support for Ukraine throughout the war.

### Thousands Protest in Israel Over Gaza Hostages

Thousands of protesters gathered in central Tel Aviv over the weekend, demanding stronger government action to secure the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Demonstrators, frustrated by the lack of progress, pressured Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to push for a peaceful resolution. Last week, over 750,000 attended [similar rallies](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/9/8/tens-of-thousands-of-israelis-protest-as-calls-for-captive-deal-intensify).

Momentum for a ceasefire has grown after a [video](https://apnews.com/article/gaza-hostages-tunnel-israel-hamas-2a86b4287b548832f31429816b5ea482) (warning—sensitive) emerged showing the poor conditions in which hostages are held. Dissatisfaction with Netanyahu’s handling of the situation is growing, even among right-wing supporters who typically back the government’s stance on Gaza.

### Houthis Strike Israel for the First Time

Yemen's Houthi rebels fired a missile into Israel for the first time, landing in a deserted area with no casualties reported. The Israeli air defense system failed to intercept the missile, launched in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

The Houthis, backed by Iran, are another proxy group fighting against Israel in the region, similar to Hamas. Prime Minister Netanyahu has [vowed retaliation](https://www.gov.il/en/pages/spoke-start150924), though concerns are rising that this strike could complicate ongoing ceasefire and hostage negotiations. Israelis worry the incident will give Netanyahu a reason to stall peace efforts.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is the Kyoto Protocol, and Why Didn’t the U.S. Ratify It?**

![Kyoto Protocol set emissions targets for industrialized nations in 1997](/images/what-is-kyoto-protocol--Y0Nz.webp)

The [Kyoto Protocol](https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol) was adopted in December 1997 and entered force in 2005. It was the first international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change. Under its framework, industrialized countries had to commit to legally binding targets for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This was also to recognize their historical responsibility for global warming. Developing nations with major emissions, such as China and India, were not required to reduce emissions, reflecting the principle of ["common but differentiated responsibilities.”](https://www.britannica.com/topic/common-but-differentiated-responsibilities)

While the Kyoto Protocol marked a significant step toward global climate action, it faced challenges. Some major emitters, such as the United States, never ratified the agreement, and compliance mechanisms were limited. The lack of commitments from developing countries slowed down the global impact. The number of emissions from 1997 to 2006 had grown 24%. Still, even with these limitations and shortcomings, Kyoto laid the groundwork for future agreements, such as the [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement) of 2015, which sought more inclusive participation and greater flexibility in addressing climate change.

Despite its groundbreaking role in climate action, the U.S. refused to ratify the treaty. The primary reasons were economic—fears that the agreement would harm U.S. industries and jobs—and concerns over the lack of binding commitments for developing nations. Critics argued the treaty’s framework was impractical, though it laid the groundwork for more inclusive agreements like the Paris Agreement.
