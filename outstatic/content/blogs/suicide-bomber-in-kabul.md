### Suicide bomber in Kabul kills 6

An [explosion in Kabul](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/2/blast-kills-at-least-six-people-in-afghan-capital-13-wounded), Afghanistan, went off Monday afternoon and killed six people and injured 13. The attack was claimed on Tuesday by the group ​​ISIS/ ISIL group. They said in a telegram group that this attack was revenge for the “Muslims held in Taliban prisons.” Interestingly enough, ISIL is one of the biggest security threats to Afghanistan. Many would have guessed it is the West.  They have been less of an issue since the Taliban took over, but there is one part where they are more influential. They were responsible for an attack that happened in 2022, which killed 53 people. Extremist infighting is a thing. 

### Venezuela update: Arrest warrants and plane seizures

A lot has been happening in Venezuela in the last day. The US took President Nicholas Maduro’s airplane to the Dominican Republic because its acquisition violated the sanctions. Also, Venezuela released an [arrest warrant](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20240903-venezuelan-judge-issues-arrest-warrant-issued-for-maduro-opposition-leader) for opposition leader Gonzalez Urrutia, who claims he is the legitimate winner of the July election. The US, the EU, and other countries have also refused to acknowledge the official election results. Maduro is calling for his imprisonment and the imprisonment of the previous opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado. It could happen as the courts stacked among those in his favor.

Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo have said that 129 people died while trying to [escape a prison](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/03/africa/dr-congo-prison-break-intl/index.html) in the capital of Khinasha. Twenty-four of them were shot to death, while the rest died of suffocation from the crowd. The prison was designed for 1,500 prisoners but currently holds around 15,000. Human rights groups have criticized the prison as it has overcrowding and inhumane conditions. Many are also held there for too long, waiting for the trial. The government will have an emergency meeting to try to resolve this problem. 

### Israeli and Hamas leadership reluctant to make changes

A lot is still in the way of a ceasefire-hostage agreement, mainly on account of both Hamas and Israeli leadership. Benjamin Netanyahu has gotten around the protests and even criticism by US President Biden Biden by sticking to the notion that Israel would not relinquish [control over a strategic corridor](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/02/biden-says-netanyahu-not-doing-enough-to-secure-ceasefire-with-hamas) along the Gaza-Egyptian border. This was one of the heated reasons the last ceasefire deal did not happen. Hamas has also said it will send the rest of the hostages in coffins. A lot of Israeli society has grown opposed to the fighting in Gaza in the last 11 months; this grew last weekend when the six bodies of the hostages were discovered.  

### Azerbaijan ruling party wins snap elections

Azerbaijan had a [snap election](https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/02/president-aliyevs-ruling-party-wins-azerbaijan-snap-election-exit-polls-say) last Sunday, and the ruling party came up on top. But it's still a lead.  Since the independence from the Soviet Union in the 1990s, Azeri elections have not been regarded as entirely free or fair. Azerbaijan is marked perpetually towards the bottom of most freedom indexes. President Ilham Aliyev's party won 68 out of 125 Azerbaijan parliament seats. The rest of the seats went to small pro-government parties or independents. Most of these parties make up a few seats each. The Aliyev family has ruled Azerbaijan since independence. They have been tough on dissent and even tougher with its Armenian neighbor. It has been on and off fighting with them since independence as well.
