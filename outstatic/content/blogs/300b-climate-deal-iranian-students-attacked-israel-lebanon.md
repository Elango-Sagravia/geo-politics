### $300B climate pledge

At COP29 in Baku, delegates finalized a [climate finance deal](https://www.dw.com/en/cop29-world-agrees-to-300bn-deal-for-developing-countries/a-70865529) after extended negotiations, committing developed nations to provide $300 billion annually by 2035 to help poorer countries address climate change. The deal was met with mixed reactions: while some, like the EU, called it a stepping stone, others, including India and the Least Developed Countries bloc, criticized it as insufficient. 

UN Secretary-General António Guterres emphasized the need for swift implementation, calling it a foundation for future action. Despite two weeks of intense negotiations, [walkouts](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/23/climate/cop29-agreement/index.html), and divisions, the agreement was finalized early Sunday, more than 30 hours past the deadline. Critics from developing nations called the funding insufficient, while COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev praised the achievement, saying, “People doubted we could deliver.”

### Iranian students violence

Iran has [condemned](https://www.dw.com/en/iran-alarmed-by-treatment-of-students-at-russian-university/a-70866504) the reported beating of Iranian students by police at Kazan Federal University in Russia. The incident allegedly occurred during a visa renewal process on Friday, where a dispute led to the arrest and mistreatment of two Iranian students. They were released after intervention by the Iranian consulate, which called the actions of Russian authorities “inhumane and unprofessional.”

Iranian Ambassador Kazem Jalali demanded accountability, and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is addressing the issue. The students reportedly suffered bruises but are otherwise unharmed. Russian authorities claim the detained students used violence against officials. The incident could [strain](https://iranwire.com/en/politics/135529-anti-russian-sentiment-surges-in-iran-after-israels-attack-exposes-moscows-inaction/) the growing defense and economic ties between Iran and Russia, which include drone supplies for Russia’s war in Ukraine. Neither the Russian Embassy in Iran nor Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has commented.

### Israel-Hezbollah strikes

Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon over the weekend have [killed dozens](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/24/g-s1-35643/israeli-strike-kills-lebanese-soldier-as-hezbollah-fires-rockets-at-israel), including 29 people in Beirut’s Basta neighborhood, after a multi-story residential building was leveled, according to Lebanese officials. The strike, reportedly using “bunker-busting” bombs, injured 66 others. Rescue operations continue amid the rubble, with no senior Hezbollah members believed to have been present in the targeted building.

Israeli strikes extended across Lebanon, killing 13 people, including four children, in the Baalbek-Hermel region, while other attacks in eastern towns left 11 dead and 32 injured. In Tyre, strikes killed five and wounded 19. Hezbollah also [ramped up](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/11/25/live-destruction-in-tel-aviv-beirut-amid-hezbollah-israel-missile-fire) strikes this weekend and made multiple strikes in Tel Aviv. Clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters intensified near Khiam in southern Lebanon. Israel has ramped up operations against Hezbollah in recent months, targeting strongholds in Beirut’s southern suburbs and other areas. 

**🇵🇭 The Philippines:** Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte [sparked controversy](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/23/asia/philippines-duterte-marcos-intl-hnk/index.html) by claiming she would instruct an assassin to kill President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., his wife Liza, and House Speaker Martin Romualdez if she were assassinated. In a press conference, she criticized Marcos as unfit to govern, highlighting their deteriorating relationship since their 2022 electoral partnership collapsed over policy disagreements. The government is investigating the threat as a national security issue and enhancing Marcos' security. This feud, marked by budget cuts to Duterte’s office and her public criticisms of Marcos, indicates rising tensions ahead of the pivotal 2025 midterm elections.

**🇵🇰 Pakistan:** A seven-day [ceasefire](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pakistan-government-mediators-seek-ceasefire-68-killed-sectarian-viole-rcna181531) was established in Pakistan’s Kurram district between rival Shi’ite and Sunni groups after violent clashes left at least 68 dead and many injured. The violence erupted when [gunmen attacked](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gunmen-kill-50-in-ambush-on-convoy-in-pakistans-kurram-district/articleshow/115540112.cms) civilian convoys on Thursday, killing 40 primarily Shi’ite individuals and leading to retaliatory strikes against Sunni communities. Mediated by government officials, the ceasefire includes provisions for prisoner and body exchanges, with ongoing curfews, closed markets, and schools. There are concerns that the death toll could rise due to continued skirmishes in remote areas.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is the ICC?**

![](/images/what-is-the-icc-cyNj.jpg)

The [International Criminal Court](https://www.icc-cpi.int/) (ICC) is a global tribunal to address some of the world’s most serious crimes. It was established under the [Rome Statute](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-11809908) in 1998 and started operating on July 1, 2002, with its headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands.

The ICC focuses on prosecuting individuals rather than not countries or organizations responsible for crimes like genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes of aggression. These include acts like mass killings, torture, targeting civilians during conflicts, or using child soldiers.

The ICC is separate from the United Nations but works alongside it. It only steps in if a country’s legal system can’t or won’t handle the case. The court ensures that influential individuals can’t escape accountability for their actions. While it’s not without its controversies, hypocrisy, and flaws, the ICC is essential in promoting justice and deterring atrocities worldwide.
