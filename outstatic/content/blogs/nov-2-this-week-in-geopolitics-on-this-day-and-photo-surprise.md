### THIS WEEK IN GEOPOLITICS

\
**Lithuania’s opposition wins**: Lithuania’s parliamentary elections resulted in a strong lead for the [Social Democrats](https://www.dw.com/en/lithuania-opposition-social-democrats-win-election/a-70611400) (SD), who are expected to form a coalition focused on economic issues like rising living costs and social inequality while addressing national [security concerns ](https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/2254924/does-russia-pose-real-threat-to-lithuania-poll-shows-most-lithuanians-think-yes)regarding Russia. With inflation over 20%, dissatisfaction with the ruling [Homeland Union](https://www.delfi.lt/en/politics/homeland-union-leader-resigns-120060494) has grown. About 75% of Lithuanians fear a possible Russian attack. The new parliament may also reconsider Lithuania’s strict policies on China, which have impacted the economy. The SD will need to tackle both domestic challenges and international relations for stability and growth.

**Israel bans UNWRA:** Israel’s Knesset recently enacted laws [barring](https://www.dw.com/en/israeli-knesset-votes-to-cut-off-unrwas-aid-to-palestinians/a-70614570) the UN Relief and Works Agency [(UNRWA)](https://www.unrwa.org/how-you-can-help/how-we-are-funded) from operating in Israeli-controlled areas, including the West Bank and Gaza, and preventing official engagement with the agency. This action restricts UNRWA’s ability to provide essential services like healthcare and food aid to millions of Palestinian refugees. Israel defends the move by [citing alleged bias](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/what-to-know-about-2-new-israeli-bills-that-could-halt-unrwas-aid-delivery-to-gaza) and links to Hamas, which UNRWA denies. International responses, including from the U.S., [caution](https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-palestine-gaza-war-10-28-24#cm2scymky000n356mn6s1m39u) that such restrictions could worsen humanitarian conditions and impact regional stability.

**Sudanese conflict continues:** The Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces ([RSF](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/16/sudan-unrest-what-is-the-rapid-support-forces)) are accused of [killing over 120 civilians](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rll0xv8gko) and displacing thousands in [Gezira province](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Al+Jazirah,+Sudan/@14.4857208,32.1732627,8.29z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x168b823778d80b5d:0x27aa2237def5491b!8m2!3d14.4275191!4d33.258793!16zL20vMDM5djd6?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAyOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) following military setbacks, sparking international condemnation. Since April 2023, RSF and Sudanese military clashes have caused severe civilian suffering. The RSF reportedly receives financial and military [support from the UAE](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/sudan-uae-war-arms-trade-rsf), which aids Sudan’s humanitarian crisis but also provides arms to the RSF, aligning with UAE interests in Sudan’s land, agriculture, and Red Sea access.

**North Korean troops in Russia:** NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte [confirmed](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241028-nato-chief-rutte-confirms-north-korean-troops-deployed-to-russia) that North Korean troops are now positioned in Russia’s [Kursk region](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kursk+Oblast,+Russia/@51.6677647,34.9800862,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x412f0579d6594437:0xad02dfc2bf4338a8!8m2!3d51.7634026!4d35.3811812!16zL20vMDJmbmgx?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAyOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), signaling deepened Russia-North Korea military cooperation amid the Ukraine conflict. This development raises security concerns, with Ukrainian leaders urging allies to permit expanded responses within Russia’s borders. Meanwhile, India has offered to mediate between Russia and Ukraine, with Indian PM Narendra Modi seen as a potentially [constructive intermediary](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/10/22/indian-pm-modi-calls-for-quick-end-to-ukraine-war-in-meeting-with-putin-a86774) due to India’s strong relationships with both countries.

**Hungarian FM joins Russian Security Forum:** Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto’s attendance at the [Minsk Conference on Eurasian Security](https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-peter-szijjarto-join-russia-syria-belarus-security-summit/) with Russian and Syrian counterparts underscores Hungary’s growing ties with Russia and Belarus, diverging from typical NATO positions. This comes amid scrutiny of Hungary’s connections to Moscow, including PM Viktor Orbán’s recent [visit to Georgia](https://www.politico.eu/article/viktor-orban-congratulates-georgia-election-victory-georgian-dream-russia-ukraine-war/) in support of the pro-Russia Georgian Dream party, which drew protests. The conference, hosted by the CSTO, aims to provide a Russia-aligned alternative to the [Munich Security Conference](https://securityconference.org/en/about-us/about-the-msc/).
