### Argentina's Poverty Rate Surges in 2024

![Argentina's Poverty Rate Surges in 2024](/images/argentinas-poverty-soars-in-2024-Y3MT.webp)

Argentina's poverty rate jumped to nearly 53% in the first half of the year, up from 41.7% at the end of 2023. This sharp rise is linked to President Javier Milei's harsh [austerity measures](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/13/argentina-violence-protests-president-milei-buenos-aires-austerity-economy-measures) to fix the country’s deep fiscal deficit. While investors have welcomed these cuts, they’ve pushed Argentina into a recession, with inflation still very high.

The impact of the austerity measures on ordinary working-class people has been severe, with many struggling to get by. The government has expanded some welfare programs, like the Universal Child Allowance, but has also cut others, making life harder for many Argentines. Javier Milei is a self-described “Anarcho-Capitalist” who has been a controversial figure in Argentina with many different reactions. He has also ruffled feathers with other South American leaders on varying [diplomatic issues](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/02/javier-milei-argentina-brazil-bolivia).

### US Leadership Continues to Back Ukraine

Vice President Kamala Harris, alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, rejected several proposed peace plans for Ukraine, dismissing them as aligned with Russian interests. Harris emphasized that these plans demand too many concessions from Ukraine, particularly regarding territory and neutrality. President Joe Biden reinforced the U.S. commitment to Ukraine, pledging an additional $5.5 billion in aid but has yet to clarify whether long-range missile support will be provided. He is also planning a [summit](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-biden-calls-germany-meeting-of-kyiv-allies/a-70331606) with Ukraine leadership in Germany next month.

Zelensky's [visit](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y30244467o) to Washington focused on rallying U.S. support and presenting his victory plan. He urged continued military aid, especially long-range missiles, to counter Russian aggression.

### Japanese Ship Sails Through Taiwan Strait for First Time

A Japanese warship, the [JS Sazanami](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm28yd04xxno), sailed through the Taiwan Strait for the first time, accompanied by Australian and New Zealand ships. This passage is significant because Japan usually avoids the strait to avoid angering China, and it was part of military exercises in the South China Sea.

China, which claims the Taiwan Strait, complained about this. Japan has not given a clear comment or explanation but often cites military discretion and acknowledges growing concerns over China's frequent [airspace violations](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr40dpz1rkwo). The Taiwan Strait is a crucial international shipping route, and more countries like the US, Canada, Australia, and Germany have increased patrols to assert freedom of navigation, challenging China's claims. This marks a shift in Japan’s stance, showing increased naval presence in response to China's maritime actions. Two [German warships](https://apnews.com/article/germany-china-taiwan-strait-warship-0bc53be4d6dc363c5ef21eedfc721206) also sailed through the straits two weeks ago for the first time in twenty years.

### Netanyahu Rejects US-French Ceasefire Proposal

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a U.S.-France proposal for a [21-day ceasefire with Hezbollah](https://www.presidentialsummary.com/archives/oceans-acidifying), reaffirming Israel's intent to continue its military operations. The ceasefire was supposed to pause hostilities between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Netanyahu [dismissed the proposal](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1839227205022257224), stating that the Israel Defense Forces would keep fighting in Lebanon and Gaza "with full force" until Israel’s war objectives are met. This follows escalating violence since Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, with daily rocket exchanges between Hezbollah and Israeli forces.

Netanyahu [asserted](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5131429/israel-netanyahu-un-speech-lebanon-gaza-iran) that Israel is winning on multiple fronts and vowed to target Iran and its proxies across the Middle East. Simultaneously, Israeli airstrikes hit Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut. His remarks followed criticism from Arab leaders. His speech on Friday had a lot of people leave. Netanyahu refuted these claims, insisting Israel is defending itself against Hamas and other militant groups.

### Armenian PM Pashinyan Sees Peace with Azerbaijan Within Reach

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan told the UN General Assembly that peace with Azerbaijan is [closer in reach](https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20240927-peace-with-azerbaijan-within-reach-says-armenian-pm) following decades of conflict, including last year's Azerbaijani military victory in Nagorno-Karabakh. He urged immediate action, emphasizing reconciliation and committing to Azerbaijan’s key demand of securing transportation links across Armenian territory to Azerbaijan's exclave, Nakhchivan, connecting it to Turkey.

Pashinyan acknowledged lingering issues, including objections to Armenia's constitution mentioning Nagorno-Karabakh, but downplayed them, insisting a peace agreement would resolve concerns. While 80% of the treaty is reportedly ready, Azerbaijan wants all matters settled first. Pashinyan pressed for swift action, stressing that diplomatic ties would aid in solving the remaining challenges. This week, [Pashyian met with Turkish President](https://armenpress.am/en/article/1200664) Recep Erdogan in New York. Turkey is a brother country to Azerbaijan geopolitically, and Turkey is another country with which Armenia has disputes.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why is Switzerland Neutral?**

![Switzerland Neutral](/images/how-did-switzerland-manage-their-neutrality-in-europe--k2Nj.webp)

Aside from the chocolates and picture-esque alpine landscape that come to the average mind when considering Switzerland, the topic is its neutrality status. Switzerland’s neutrality has been carefully maintained for over five centuries, and its commitment to this stance was formalized during the 1815 [Congress of Vienna](https://www.britannica.com/event/Congress-of-Vienna). The congress recognized Switzerland’s permanent neutrality, establishing it as a core part of European diplomacy. This declaration aimed to preserve peace in the region, especially as Switzerland is surrounded by major European powers like Germany, France, and Italy. By officially adopting neutrality, Switzerland avoided becoming a battleground during Europe’s many wars​.

Switzerland has preserved its neutral stance through diplomacy, military readiness, and strict non-alignment policies. Despite being neutral, Switzerland has maintained a well-trained military, ensuring it can defend its borders if necessary. During both World Wars, Switzerland fortified its defenses and mobilized its army, sending a clear signal that while it wouldn’t take sides, it would defend its sovereignty if threatened. Additionally, Switzerland strictly refrains from joining military alliances like NATO, further reinforcing its neutral stance​.

Another key to Switzerland’s neutral status is its role in global diplomacy. Hosting organizations like the [United Nations in Geneva](https://www.ungeneva.org/en/about/who-we-are) and acting as a mediator in various international conflicts, Switzerland has built a reputation as a hub for peace talks and humanitarian efforts. This diplomatic neutrality has allowed it to navigate complex geopolitical tensions while remaining a respected global player in conflict resolution.
