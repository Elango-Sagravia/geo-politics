### THIS WEEK IN GEOPOLITICS

**Moldova votes YES for EU:** Moldova voted narrowly to join the European Union, with [50.4% in favor](https://www.dw.com/en/moldova-narrowly-votes-yes-to-eu-membership/a-70544401) and 49.6% against. The results shifted late with votes from Moldovans abroad. Amid accusations of [Russian interference,](https://www.dw.com/en/moldovas-eu-referendum-beset-by-alleged-russian-meddling/a-70527782) Pro-Western President Maia Sandu attributed the close results to foreign influence. This pro-EU win is viewed as a setback for Russia. Moldova aims for EU membership by 2030, but challenges remain, as accession can take over a decade.

**China-India dispute resolved:** India and China have agreed on new patrolling arrangements along their [disputed Himalayan border,](https://apnews.com/article/india-china-ladakh-border-standoff-c7c5fcf61b2378428842207b52b547c3) aiming to reduce tensions that escalated into [deadly clashes](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-54067400) in 2020. While details are unclear, the agreement seeks to ensure disengagement at the Line of Actual Control and ease relations ahead of Prime Minister Modi's visit to Russia for the [BRICS summit](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/brics-summit-moldova-votes-yes-israel-documents-leaked). The relationship between the two nations is complex, stemming from territorial disputes and their status as significant rivals in Asia. Historically, relations were warmer in the 1950s after Indiaâ€™s independence and the foundation of Modern China.

**BRICS Summit:** This week, the [BRICS summit in Kazan](https://www.euronews.com/2024/10/21/putin-to-host-brics-summit-in-a-bid-to-advance-russias-own-interests), Russia, featured leaders like Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Despite Western isolation due to the Ukraine conflict, the summit underscores Russia's defiance and [BRICS](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-66525474)â€™ growing influence with new members like Iran and Saudi Arabia. Putin aims to strengthen global alliances and secure economic deals, while [China and India](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vlxx9pgxwo) focus on expanding trade and military ties. [Brazilian President](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89l45zeq2eo) Luiz Lula da Silva joined the summit via video link after canceling his in-person attendance due to a head injury.

**Israel Targets Hezbollah Finances:** The United Nations condemned Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon targeting Hezbollahâ€™s [financial infrastructure](https://www.dw.com/en/un-condemns-damage-from-israeli-strikes-in-beirut/live-70548957), including the Al-Qard Al-Hassan association. Israel claimed it struck an [underground vault](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3283296/hezbollah-cash-vault-hit-israeli-army-says-it-seeks-degrade-movements-funding) containing funds for Hezbollah. The UN criticized the strikes for damaging civilian areas and urged respect for international humanitarian law. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in the Middle East for the 11th time to discuss the Gaza conflict. He is trying to work on an agreement to end the hostilities and secure hostage releases. He emphasizes delivering aid to Gaza and seeking diplomatic solutions with Hezbollah, though many remain skeptical about potential outcomes.

**Turkish Retaliation:** A recent [attack](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/23/europe/turkey-ankara-aerospace-attack-intl/index.html) near Ankara on Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) left five dead and 22 injured. Turkish officials suspect the [PKK](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20971100), though no group has claimed responsibility. The attackers, a man and a woman, were killed, prompting international condemnation. In retaliation, Turkey conducted [airstrikes](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/24/turkey-strikes-iraq-syria-after-attack-on-defence-company-near-ankara) against PKK targets in northern Iraq and Syria. This incident has intensified scrutiny of Turkey's policies towards Kurdish groups, particularly the [SDF](https://ecfr.eu/special/mena-armed-groups/syrian-democratic-forces-syria/), which Turkey links to the PKK, a designated terrorist organization.
