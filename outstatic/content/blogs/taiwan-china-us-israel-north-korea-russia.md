### Taiwan-China War Games

Tensions between China and Taiwan have risen significantly during Xi Jinping's presidency, marked by China's heightened [military drills](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/14/asia/china-military-drills-taiwan-intl-hnk/index.html) and aggressive rhetoric. The recent military exercises conducted by the [People’s Liberation Army (PLA)](https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/08/five-things-know-about-chinas-armed-forces) in October 2024 involved extensive sea and air patrols, including simulations of blockades and assaults on critical Taiwanese targets. 

These provocative actions have raised concerns internationally, with the United States urging China to [exercise restraint](https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202410110005) and avoid actions that could lead to regional destabilization. China's substantial investment in these military exercises underscores its firm commitment to asserting influence over Taiwan despite the potential for facing resistance from the broader international community.

### US Sends Defense System to Israel

![The U.S. is deploying a THAAD missile defense system to Israel to enhance air defense](/images/us-deploys-thaad-anti-missile-system-to-israel-after-iranian-attack-k3Nj.webp)

The U.S. is deploying a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense [(THAAD) ](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12645/2)system to Israel to strengthen its air defense following recent [missile threats](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/02/middleeast/iran-missiles-israel-defenses-intl-hnk-ml/index.html) from Iran. This move, approved by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, underscores the U.S.’s commitment to protecting Israel from escalating regional tensions, particularly after Iran’s ballistic missile attacks [earlier this year](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/israel-launches-ground-offensive-rutte-takes-nato-helm-iran-escalates).

The THAAD system, capable of intercepting long-range ballistic missiles, adds a crucial layer to Israel’s air defense alongside [existing systems](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20385306). This deployment occurs amidst clashes between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and as Iran warns against U.S. involvement in the conflict. While aimed at reinforcing Israel’s defenses, the move risks further inflaming tensions in the region. The U.S. has a history of military collaboration with Israel, including a previous [THAAD deployment for training in 2019](https://www.twz.com/26749/u-s-sends-thaad-to-israel-for-first-time-as-both-countries-slam-irans-missile-programs).​

### Zelensky: North Korea Aiding Russia

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused North Korea of deepening its involvement in the war by sending both weapons and troops to [support Russia’s invasion](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241013-zelensky-says-north-korea-has-sent-troops-to-support-russian-military) of Ukraine. In his address, Zelensky highlighted an [increasing alliance](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/10/a-russia-north-korea-alliance-in-the-works-dont-be.html) between Russia and authoritarian regimes like North Korea, stressing that Pyongyang’s role has escalated from merely providing arms to now transferring personnel to assist Russian military efforts.

Simultaneously, tensions are rising for North Korea along its southern border. Pyongyang has [accused South Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/north-korea-south-korea-drones-accusations-pyongyang) of using drones to drop anti-North leaflets over its capital, sparking a heated response. North Korea has threatened to [destroy border-crossing roads](https://www.dw.com/en/seoul-says-north-korea-moving-to-blow-up-cross-border-roads/a-70483720) and placed artillery units on high alert. Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of leader Kim Jong Un, condemned South Korea and the U.S. for the incident, accusing them of provoking conflict.​ North Korea ensures it isn’t ignored in a crucial geopolitical uncertain time.

### Sudan Airstrikes Kill 23

Recent [airstrikes by the Sudanese military](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62d1zlypddo) in southern Khartoum have killed at least 23 people and injured over 40. The attacks targeted areas near a market and a residential zone close to the main camp of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). This comes amid the ongoing 18-month conflict between the RSF and the military, which has claimed up to 150,000 lives and displaced around 20% of Sudan’s population.

Hospitals are overburdened with casualties as fighting gets worse un in Khartoum, primarily controlled by the RSF. Meanwhile, the Sudanese government [accuses the UAE](https://apnews.com/article/un-sudan-uae-weapons-government-paramilitary-war-859bf38f1a6f6a5647fb528d3818f5bb) of arming the RSF, which the Gulf state denies. The UN warns the conflict has created the world’s most enormous hunger and displacement crises, bringing immense suffering to civilians ([see video](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8xelg27lgo), warning—sensitive).

### Israel Breach UN Base in Lebanon

Israeli tanks recently broke through the gate of a [UN peacekeeping base](https://www.dw.com/en/unifil-why-are-un-peacekeepers-in-lebanon/a-70471965) (UNIFIL) in southern Lebanon. This [incident](https://www.dw.com/en/middle-east-israeli-tanks-break-through-peacekeeper-base-un/live-70480907) occurred amidst rising tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had previously called for the UN to evacuate peacekeepers from battle zones in Lebanon as Israel’s military operations intensified in the region.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the attacks on peacekeepers, stating that they could constitute war crimes. This follows increased hostilities, with Israeli forces engaged in combat with Hezbollah militants, leading to injuries among UN peacekeepers and an escalation in the conflict. Israel’s Western allies have cautioned Israel on further escalation but have yet to halt military support.

### FOUNDATIONS

**(Why) does Catalonia want to separate from Spain?**

Catalonia is an autonomous region in northeastern Spain renowned for its rich cultural identity, distinct language, and vibrant history. Its capital, Barcelona, stands as a central economic hub with global influence. Barcelona is famous for its architecture, including the works of [Antoni Gaudí](https://medium.com/@nattsudarshan/oh-my-gaudi-201fe3622e70), and its strong tourism and business sectors. While Catalonia enjoys a significant degree of self-governance, controlling areas such as education, healthcare, and local policing, many Catalans have long aspired to full independence, driven by historical grievances and a sense of cultural uniqueness.

In 2017, Catalonia held a controversial [independence referendum](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29478415), with over 90% of voters favoring secession. However, turnout was just around 43%, mainly due to the Spanish government declaring the vote illegal and deploying police to prevent it, leading to [violent clashes](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2017-006260_EN.html) between voters and police forces. The referendum reignited long-standing tensions between Catalonia and Madrid.

In recent years, however, the separatist movement has lost momentum. Catalonia’s most recent elections saw nationalist parties struggle to gain a majority, reflecting a [shift in public sentiment](https://www.politico.eu/article/5-key-things-to-know-about-catalonias-elections-nationalist-parties-failed-secure-majority/). Economic uncertainty and the legal complexities of gaining EU membership have also tempered calls for independence.
