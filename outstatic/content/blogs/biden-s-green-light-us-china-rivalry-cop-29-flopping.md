### Biden greenlights long-range missiles

President Joe Biden has [authorized](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241117-us-for-the-first-time-authorises-ukraine-s-use-of-long-range-missiles-inside-russia) Ukraine to strike Russian territory with U.S.-supplied long-range [ATACMS](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/18/atacms-missiles-what-are-they-why-they-important-for-ukraine) missiles. The authorization is a move to supportÂ  Kyiv further. The decision reportedly responds to [North Korea](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2796pdm1lo) deploying around 10,000 troops to assist Russia. Previously, Washington hesitated to approve such actions, citing concerns over depleting U.S. munitions and escalating the conflict.

This shift, confirmed by a U.S. official, allows Ukraine to target key Russian military sites, a long-standing request by President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia has warned that such actions would mean NATO is effectively at war with Moscow, which raises the stakes further.

The policy change occurred as Biden transitioned out of office to President-elect Donald Trump, who claimed he could negotiate an end to the conflict. This move might push European allies to reconsider their positions. Germany is still reluctant to supply [Taurus missiles](https://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-scholz-germany-no-missiles-ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-russia-war/), citing fears of escalating the war beyond Ukrainian borders.

### APEC: China and US rivalry

![APEC summit highlights U.S.-China rivalry as Xi promotes globalization and Biden navigates shifting U.S. influence](/images/apec--china-and-us-rivalry-in-latin-america-Q0ND.webp)

The recent [APEC summit](https://www.apecperu.pe/2024/en/) in Lima underscored shifting global dynamics as U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed critical trade and geopolitical issues amid changing American leadership. Bidenâ€™s arrival was a bit behind, which resulted in an awkward traditional photo. Some believe this fits his outgoing administrationâ€™s limited ability to cement long-term U.S. influence in the Pacific region.Â 

In contrast, Xi championed globalization, leveraging Chinaâ€™s investments, such as a [$1.3 billion](https://www.newsweek.com/china-news-xi-megaport-chancay-warships-1985770) Peruvian mega port, to reject protectionism and position China as a stabilizing global force. In addition to the Pacific region, China is now gaining in South America and possibly more of Latin America in terms of economic competition with the US. With the election of Donald Trump, the U.S. could soon have a new global role from business as usual. APECâ€™s outcomes reflect broader uncertainties about future international cooperation.

### Cop 29 isnâ€™t showing promising developments

The [COP29 climate summit](https://www.politico.eu/article/explaining-trillion-dollar-question-disrupting-cop29/) is just past the halfway mark. One of the significant issues exposed is the urgent need for increased climate finance and implementation efforts. Wealthy countries, including the U.S. and many European nations, are pushing to maintain the current target of $100 billion in annual climate finance. In contrast, 134 developing countries demand a much higher targetâ€”up to $1.3 trillion annually. The debate is primarily driven by a divide between rich and developing nations, with wealthy countries seeking to limit their financial commitments and urging significant emitters like China to contribute.

Negotiations face challenges, including fossil fuel industry influence, with over 1,700 lobbyists present. Calls for reform from figures like Ban Ki-Moon emphasize shifting from negotiations to action as global emissions rise. [Data](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/18/half-way-through-the-cop29-climate-summit-and-the-frustration-is-showing) reveals cities like Shanghai, Tokyo, and Houston as significant polluters, while the Permian Basin in Texas ranks as the worldâ€™s worst single-site emitter.

**ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡© Bangladesh:** Bangladeshâ€™s International Crimes Tribunal is [intensifying](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bangladesh-tribunal-hear-updates-police-moves-arrest-ousted-115957437) its investigation into former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her allies for alleged crimes against humanity following a deadly uprising this year. The interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, seeks Hasina's [extradition](https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-extradition-india-4265a19fe3144af5f7347072e8c64a14) from India, where she has been in exile since August. Protests over government jobs escalated into a nationwide anti-government movement, resulting in violent crackdowns and hundreds of deaths, leading to the end of Hasinaâ€™s 15-year rule. So far, 20 suspects have been arrested, with 13 appearing in court, while efforts continue to locate Hasina and others still at large. The case attracts significant attention as the country navigates its political and legal future.

**ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª Venezuela:** Venezuelan authorities have [released](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yx5qzzypgo) 107 people detained during protests following Julyâ€™s controversial presidential [election](https://www.state.gov/assessing-the-results-of-venezuelas-presidential-election/), according to Foro Penal, a local rights group. The election declared President NicolÃ¡s Maduro the winner with 52% of the vote, which has been widely disputed. The opposition refuses to accept it and believes candidate Edmundo GonzÃ¡lez is the rightful winner and won by a significant margin. The results sparked mass protests, leading to over 1,800 arrests, with charges ranging from terrorism to incitement to hatred. Social media videos captured detainees' emotional release from multiple prisons, greeted by cheering crowds. Meanwhile, Maduro is preparing to begin his third term in January as the international community questions the election's legitimacy.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why is the Strait of Hormuz important?**

![The Strait of Hormuz is a vital energy route, crucial for global oil flow and geopolitical stability](/images/why-is-strait-of-hormuz-important-MyND.webp)

The [Strait of Hormuz](https://www.britannica.com/place/Strait-of-Hormuz) is one of the worldâ€™s most strategically important waterways. It is between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, a [narrow passage](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Strait+of+Hormuz/@26.5866462,55.813409,9.14z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x3ef7184c25840e51:0x3d7b86ccdd367e5a!8m2!3d26.5944754!4d56.4719928!16zL20vMDc1dDk?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) linking the oil-rich Middle East to global markets. Around 20-25% of the worldâ€™s oil passes through this 21-mile-wide strait, making it a key route for energy exports, particularly from countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq.

Because so much of the worldâ€™s oil flows through here, the Strait of Hormuz is vital to global energy security. Any disruption, whether due to political tensions, military conflict, or natural disasters, can send oil prices soaring and create instability in global markets.Â 

The regionâ€™s political dynamics, especially Iranâ€™s control over the northern entrance, also add to the straitâ€™s significance. Tensions between countries, mainly the U.S. and Iran, have often made the strait a flashpoint for [geopolitical conflicts](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/08/strait-of-hormuz-what-supply-disruption-could-mean-for-oil-markets.html). With its narrow width and the amount of oil traveling through it, the strait is also incredibly vulnerable to disruption. This makes it not only an economic lifeline but also a potential site for conflict. It is essential to ensure its security to maintain the stability of global energy markets and international relations.
