### Turkey Links BRICS Interest to EU Membership Delays

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan noted that Turkey's interest in joining BRICS might not have arisen had it been an EU member. He emphasized that Turkey acted in good faith when it became a candidate for EU membership in 1987. Still, the stalled negotiations have led Ankara to seek alliances elsewhere, including BRICS, which it announced its intention to join weeks ago ([see previous write-up](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/turkey-seeks-brics)).

[BRICS](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-66525474) seeks to elevate the voices of major emerging economies to challenge the Western-led global order, yet not all members share a cohesive geopolitical stance. For example, while China and India are both part of BRICS, they compete for regional dominance and have other issues, such as border disputes like Kashmir. Unlike alliances such as the EU, ASEAN, or NATO, BRICS does not operate with joint customs unions or military treaties, meaning some members may have significant differences in foreign policy despite their mutual goal of countering Western influence.

[Turkey’s EU accession journey](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2023/05/16/a-brief-history-of-turkeys-long-tortuous-road-to-join-the-european-union) has faced significant hurdles, primarily concerns over human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. Territorial disputes, such as the issue of Cyprus, also pose significant barriers, as EU member states cannot have unresolved territorial conflicts. Additionally, differing political priorities between Turkey and EU states have contributed to the ongoing deadlock, making Turkey's EU membership unlikely in the foreseeable future.

### UN Demands Israel Exit Palestinian Territories in One Year

![](/images/un-members-vote-to-demand-israel-get-out-of-palestinian-territories-in-the-next-year-U4NT.jpg)

The UN General Assembly has passed a Palestinian-drafted, non-binding resolution demanding that Israel end its "unlawful presence" in the Occupied Palestinian Territory within 12 months. The [vote](https://x.com/UN_News_Centre/status/1836426106896785428) resulted in 124 in favor, 14 against, and 43 abstentions, with Palestine unable to vote as a non-member observer state.

Israel opposed the resolution, labeling it “diplomatic terrorism.” The U.S. also voted against it, while the UK abstained, citing concerns that the resolution was one-sided and lacked clarity, failing to offer a viable path toward a lasting two-state solution. Although non-binding, the resolution reflects a growing global consensus on the necessity of addressing the occupation amid ongoing violence in the region.

### Jihadist Attack in Mali Leaves 70 Dead

A [jihadist attack](https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20240917-unidentified-gunmen-attack-military-police-base-in-malian-capital-bamako) in Mali left over 70 people dead and around 200 injured, targeting a military police training camp and the airport in the capital. This marks one of the deadliest attacks on security forces in recent years. The attack comes after the formation of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), a coalition between Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, which broke away from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) following a series of military coups.

The Sahel states have shifted their alliances toward Russia after severing ties with their former colonial power, France, deepening regional instability.

### Hong Kong Man Sentenced Under New Security Law

Chu Kai-pong, a 27-year-old Hong Kong resident, was sentenced to 14 months in prison for wearing a T-shirt with the slogan "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times." He was arrested on June 12, the anniversary of major protests in the city, making him the first individual convicted under [Hong Kong’s controversial national security law](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52765838).

Authorities argued that the slogan called for Hong Kong’s separation from China, a serious offense under the new law. Critics say the law is stifling free speech and political dissent, with increasingly severe penalties for acts Beijing deems seditious.

### Japan Demands Answers Over Stabbing in China

Japan’s Prime Minister is demanding answers from China following the stabbing of a 10-year-old Japanese student at a school in Shenzhen, marking the [second incident](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/25/china/japanese-mother-child-stabbed-china-bus-stop-intl-hnk/index.html) involving a Japanese child in China since June. The Chinese Foreign Ministry condemned the attack but described it as an isolated event, asserting it wouldn't affect Chinese-Japanese relations. 

However, anti-Japanese sentiment remains prevalent in China, fueled by historical grievances from World War II, with some critics accusing state media of exacerbating tensions. Chinese nationalists claim the stabbing was staged and question the existence of Japanese schools in China. Aside from the historical tension, Japan and China often find themselves at geopolitical odds, with Japan more aligned with Western influences.

### What were the geopolitical consequences of the fall of the Berlin Wall?

![](/images/what-were-the-geopolitical-consequences-of-the-fall-of-the-berlin-wall--Q4OT.jpg)

The fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, marked a turning point in world history. Built in 1961, the Wall symbolized the division between East and West Germany and, more broadly, between the communist Eastern Bloc and the capitalist West during the Cold War. Its collapse was triggered by mounting internal pressure in East Germany, where citizens demanded freedom of movement and political reform. After weeks of protests, East German authorities unexpectedly announced that the border would be opened.

Geopolitically, the fall of the Wall signaled the end of the Cold War and the decline of Soviet influence in Europe. One immediate consequence was the reunification of Germany, which emerged as a central power in a newly unified Europe. The fall also accelerated the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc, as countries like Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia transitioned to democracy and market economies. NATO expanded eastward as former communist nations sought security guarantees against Russia, altering the European security landscape. Overall, the event reshaped the global order, strengthening Western alliances and leading to the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union.
