### Mexico pauses US and Canada relations

Mexico’s president stated that he is temporarily [pausing relations](https://apnews.com/article/obrador-pause-salazar-us-canada-embassy-judicial-d196520eead08883d0ae86ca2d86d97f) with the Canadian and US embassies. Both were critical of his recent proposed judicial overhaul. The proposal means that judges can be elected, which many fear would put too many politically biased judges without experience in the courts. Many Mexicans demonstrated against these changes. He didn’t state what exactly he meant with the pause. Mexican President Obrador is in the final weeks of his presidency. Because of this, it doesn’t seem likely to have a long-term strain on Mexican and Canadian/US relations. 

### Pacific Islands agree to regional policing

One key outcome of the Pacific Island Forum in Tongo was the agreement to a [policing plan](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/28/pacific-islands-leaders-back-australia-funded-joint-policing-plan) backed by Australia. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the leaders favor the 271 million-dollar proposal. The plan entails putting training centers across the Pacific with a hub in Brisbane. It is to breathe a multi-country policing force of about 200 officers in the countries in the region if a significant event or crisis happens. While the forum participants agreed on it, it is up to the national leaders to decide whether to participate. One of the more significant motives was to offset Chinese influence and make it more difficult for China to use this region for its security.

The Israeli army [carried out raids](https://www.dw.com/en/israel-launches-major-military-operation-in-west-bank/a-70066327) across the occupied West Bank on Wednesday. The foreign minister said the goal of these raids was to “dismantle Iranian-Islamic terror organizations”. The raids happened mostly in the two cities of Jenin and Tulkarem. Palestinian officials claim this has killed 9 people, and the of Jenin is now sealed off. Israel claims that Iran is funding the proxy group of Hamas and smuggling weapons via Jordan. The West Bank has not suffered the same fate as Gaza but has had 679 casualties since October 7th. Most of which Israel says are terrorists, but some mistakes have been made with civilians. 

### Spanish PM goes to West Africa

​​Spanish PM Pedro Sánchez is on a [three-day tour](https://apnews.com/article/migration-mauritania-spain-west-africa-canary-islands-0611d94e68111f1e00af170ee37f9583) of West Africa. He will visit Mauritania, Gambia, and Senegal. These are the countries that launch the majority of the migrants' boats to the Canary Islands. This is a common journey to Spain, but it can be incredibly dangerous. His goal is to try to stem some of the migration with bilateral measures. He says he is not against migration and doesn’t see a problem, but wants to find a humanely regulate it. He made an agreement with Mauritania to combine security forces to combat human trafficking. The migrants who leave from these countries range between those seeking better work and those fleeing war, particularly the ones from Mali. 

### Ukraine captures more soldiers in Kursk

According to Ukrainian sources, Ukraine has captured [almost 600 Russian soldiers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/27/russia-ukraine-war-kryvyi-rih-zaporizhzhia-strikes-blackouts) in the Kursk region and has seized 100 settlements inside Russia in the last 3 weeks. This still comes as a major surprise to Russia. It was a big boost in morale and came just in time for Independence Day. However, it is still a bit early to celebrate as Russia is also making more advancements in Ukraine and has launched attacks on some valuable infrastructures. Russian attack on Monday in Ukraine targeted the energy grid and killed at least seven people. While both are making advancements, Ukraine is still in a decent position strategy-wise with Kursk. It can be used as valuable information for negotiations.
