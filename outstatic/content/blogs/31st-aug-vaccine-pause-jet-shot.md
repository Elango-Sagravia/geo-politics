### Israel agrees to a pause in Gaza for polio vaccinations

The World Health Organization has temporarily stopped fighting in Gaza to allow polio vaccinations for children under 10. Polio was eradicated in Gaza quite a few years ago, but the organization has already reported a case. There are likely some more cases. A big issue with the fighting in Gaza is that vaccines in many areas have been halted since Israel’s war in Gaza began right after October 7th. Also, the unsanitary conditions in Gaza have made it more susceptible to diseases. The [three pauses](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/8/29/israels-war-on-gaza-live-israel-warned-not-to-extend-war-to-west-bank) will occur from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. and last three days, each in different areas of Gaza. This is still far from a ceasefire but a possible step toward something constructive.

### Russia gets behind Durov

The Russian government has changed its stance regarding Telegram founder Pavel Durov. Earlier this year, Russian authorities blamed his platform for causing the shooting of a concert in Moscow, which took 145 lives. He was given a strong warning. Pavel was not always at Russia’s defense in geopolitical affairs. However, Russian officials have made a new [change of tune](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/after-years-pressure-durov-russia-suddenly-rallies-behind-him-2024-08-29/). Many believe that we orchestrated this arrest and that he is a political prisoner. While it might be questionable how much the Russian government honestly cares about Durov, his arrest makes it an easy speaking point when it comes to making a case about free speech in the West.

One of the F-16 warplanes gifted to Ukraine from the West was [shot down](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/08/30/ukraine-says-one-of-its-western-donated-f-16-fighter-jets-has-crashed-killing-the-pilot) on Thursday. The fighter jet crashed earlier this week when Russia sent a series of significant missile and drone attacks at Ukraine. These fighter jets intercepted four of the missiles. This is the first crash of a F-16 in Ukraine since they were brought to Ukraine last month. The pilot killed in the crash was Colonel Alexei Mes. He was one of the top proponents of getting these jets to Ukraine. He made the ultimate sacrifice in the end for these warplanes. Ukrainian officials see him as a true hero.

### Congolese prosecutors seek the death penalty for 50 people

Prosecutors on Tuesday are proposing the death penalty for 50 people, including three Americans, to face the [death penalty](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/28/africa/americans-coup-attempt-congo-intl/index.html) for what the Congolese army says was a coup attempt earlier this year. Congo got rid of the death penalty a couple of decades ago but reinstated it just this year. The trials for these defendants started in June. They face charges of terrorism, murder, and criminal association. Six people were killed during the attempted coup. It was led by opposition figure Christian Malanga in May and targeted the presidential palace. He was shot to death for resisting arrest. The Democratic Republic has issues with political instability; a lot of it stems from its natural resources and the scramble to get them.

### Germany deports people from Afghanistan

Germany reversed its decision to stop returning migrants to Afghanistan on Friday. 28 Afghans were put on a charter flight back to Kabul. In the 2021 Taliban takeover, Germany chose to [halt deportations](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240830-germany-deports-afghan-nationals-for-first-time-since-taliban-takeover) to Afghanistan for humanitarian reasons. This move has been criticized by some human rights groups, which have said if Germany does this, they are an accomplice to the Taliban. This decision was made a week after the deadly stabbing in Solingen. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that Germany would crack down on irregular migration. Migration has been a significant issue in Germany and other European countries. The far right is seeing surges, forcing some of the center and center-left to consider measures toward restricting it.
