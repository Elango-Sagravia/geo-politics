### Biden Hosts the Quad Summit

At the Quad summit in Wilmington, Delaware, President Joe Biden made notable remarks about China’s military activities, stating that Beijing is "testing us" in areas like the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. His comments followed opening statements from Australian, Indian, and Japanese Prime Ministers, underscoring the growing significance of the Quad in regional security.

While the joint statement from the summit did not directly mention China, it expressed strong opposition to destabilizing actions and condemned recent missile launches in the region. Biden emphasized the Quad's enduring presence, stating, "The Quad is here to stay," despite upcoming political changes in the U.S. 

The Quad, consisting of the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia, is a [strategic partnership](https://www.dfat.gov.au/international-relations/regional-architecture/quad) aimed at promoting security, cooperation, and economic development in the Indo-Pacific region. The group, formed in 2007, has taken on increasing geopolitical relevance, especially as concerns over China's actions in the Indo-Pacific intensify. Meetings between the Quad nations have become more frequent in recent years as the bloc focuses on issues like maritime security, disaster relief, and promoting a free, open, and rules-based order. 

### New French Government Revealed

The French presidential palace has unveiled a [new government](https://www.politico.eu/article/new-french-government-unveiled-michel-barnier-raising-taxes-emmanuel-macron/) led by conservative Michel Barnier. Following elections that resulted in a hung parliament and increased political tensions, Barnier's 39-member government comprises centrists and conservatives. Jean-Noël Barrot was appointed foreign minister, and Antoine Armand was appointed finance minister. 

Despite securing the most seats, the left-wing coalition fell short of a majority, leading to protests from student groups and activists who felt ignored and undervalued. Although the far-right National Rally is not represented in the Cabinet, it possesses enough parliamentary votes to destabilize the government potentially. Barnier's first significant challenge will come on October 1, when he delivers a policy speech to the National Assembly.

### Lebanon and Israel Exchange Fire 

Over the weekend, heavy fire exchanged between Israel and Hezbollah along the Lebanon border [intensified](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-hezbollah-lebanon-attacks-haifa-west-bank-al-jazeera-rcna172130) existing tensions amid the ongoing violence in Gaza. Hezbollah fired numerous rockets into Israel, damaging homes and injuring several individuals. In response, Israel targeted around 290 Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, claiming significant strikes against the group. The situation escalated following a deadly Israeli [airstrike](https://news.sky.com/story/israeli-airstrike-on-beirut-causes-more-shock-to-a-country-already-rocked-to-its-core-13218772) in Beirut that killed 45 people, including senior Hezbollah leaders.

The conflict was exacerbated by explosive devices that detonated throughout Lebanon and parts of Syria, resulting in 39 deaths and injuring several thousand. While no one has officially claimed responsibility, Israel is widely believed to be behind the attacks, which primarily targeted Hezbollah members. The fighting is raising fears of further destabilization in the region.

### East German State Votes

On Sunday, the Eastern German state of Brandenburg delivered surprising results in its [regional elections](https://www.dw.com/en/spd-set-to-finish-ahead-of-far-right-afd-in-brandenburg-vote/live-70291788). The center-left Social Democratic Party narrowly defeated the far-right Alternative for Germany. The traditional Center-Right Christian Democratic Party fell third place behind Sahra Wagenknecht's party. Voter turnout reached an estimated 73%, significantly up from 61.3% in Brandenburg's previous state poll.

While the two anti-establishment left and right parties didn’t come out on top, they still saw gains. These elections are considered a crucial test of confidence for the German government ahead of federal elections next year. The polarization evident in this vote is expected to carry over into the federal elections, posing a significant challenge to German democracy.

### Israel Forces Shut Down Al-Jazeera Office in West Bank

Israeli forces recently raided Al Jazeera's office in Ramallah, issuing a [45-day closure order](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rd5z17px4o) amidst heightened tensions during the Gaza conflict. Israeli officials accused the network of inciting terror, a claim Al Jazeera vehemently denies, calling the raid an assault on press freedom. 

The Palestinian foreign ministry and the Foreign Press Association condemned the action, highlighting the infringement on press liberties. This incident is part of a broader trend of restrictions on Al Jazeera's operations in Israel and the Palestinian territories. The network has faced similar actions in other countries; for instance, Egypt shut down its operations in 2013 after a military coup, and the UAE, Syria, and Bahrain have also imposed limits on the outlet.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is the UN Convention on Genocide?**

![UN Convention on Genocide](/images/what-is-the-genocide-convention--k0MT.webp)

The UN [Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf) is an international treaty created to stop genocide and punish those responsible. Adopted in 1948, after the horrors of the Holocaust, it was the first legal document to define genocide and make it a crime under international law.

According to the convention, genocide means trying to destroy a group of people based on their nationality, race, ethnicity, or religion. This can include killing members of the group, causing serious harm, or creating living conditions meant to wipe them out. Even acts like preventing births or forcibly moving children to another group can be considered genocide.

Countries that signed the convention made a promise to prevent and punish genocide. They must pass laws to ensure that anyone committing genocide in their country can be tried and punished. International courts, like the International Criminal Court (ICC), can hold perpetrators accountable if they fail. This convention was a crucial step in recognizing genocide as a global issue that needs action and cooperation from all countries to prevent it and bring justice to its victims. Some criticism of the convention is that it is selectively enforced, can be vague, and sometimes resources get wasted in finding what atrocities are under the definition of genocide instead of going towards stopping them.
