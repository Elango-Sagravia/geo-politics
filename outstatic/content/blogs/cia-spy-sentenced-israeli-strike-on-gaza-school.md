### Ex-CIA Officer Sentenced to 10 Years for Spying for China

Alexander Yuk Ching Ma was sentenced to 10 years in prison for spying for China. Ma, who had worked for the CIA from 1982 to 1989, was found guilty of conspiring to deliver [classified information](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevjrvkm28go) to Chinese intelligence officers. He was offered a plea deal to get out of a lifelong sentence. Ma is a native of Hong Kong and has become a naturalized US citizen.

Alexander didn’t start his activities until after his time in the CIA. This started in 2001 when he and his brother, also a former CIA officer, met with Chinese agents in Hong Kong, providing them with sensitive defense information in exchange for cash. He received a lot of lavish gifts and trips to China for his work. He was discovered when the FBI hired him as a ruse as a contract linguist. However, it took until 2020 for him to get arrested.

The more significant issue in this is that there have been a few other cases of US intelligence officers linked to [Chinese Intelligence Agencies](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/05/china-cia-spy-congress-387133). There was a high-profile case 6 years ago that brought some scrutiny to the CIA and FBI for not being able to stop it in time.

### Israeli Forces Bomb Gaza School, Killing 18

Israeli forces bombed a [school-turned-shelter](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/11/at-least-14-palestinians-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-gaza-school) in the Gaza Strip, killing 18 people, including six UN staff members. The al-Jaouni school in the Nuseirat refugee camp was sheltering over 12,000 displaced Palestinians. Israel confirmed the attack, stating it targeted a Hamas command center, though many civilians, including women and children, were also killed.

The bombing, the fifth strike on the school since October, has drawn outrage from international bodies, including the European Union, whose foreign policy chief condemned the killing of UN workers. Israel’s continued actions in Gaza are straining relationships with even its strongest allies.

### France Foils Three Terrorist Plots During Paris Olympics

France’s counter-terrorism units successfully thwarted [three terrorist plots ](https://www.dw.com/en/france-foiled-3-attacks-against-olympic-games-prosecutor/a-70191480)targeting the Paris Olympics. One of the plots involved a planned attack on Israeli representatives. Most of the threats stemmed from jihadist groups, raising concerns of a repeat of the [Munich 1972 Olympics massacre](https://www.britannica.com/event/Munich-Massacre), where 11 Israeli athletes were killed.

In addition to Islamist threats, French authorities also faced risks from far-right extremists, violent environmentalists, and potential Russian cyber-attacks. French security forces remain on high alert as the country continues to manage diverse threats during international events.

### Iran’s President visits Iraq

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian made his [first official foreign trip](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-president-visits-iraq-first-foreign-trip-2024-09-11/) since taking office, visiting Iraq to strengthen ties and discuss regional issues, including the conflict in Gaza. Iraq is in a unique position, being an ally of both Iran and the U.S., with 2,500 U.S. troops stationed in the country alongside Iran-backed armed factions.

During his visit, Pezeshkian also met with [Kurdish leaders](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240912-iran-president-arrives-in-iraqi-kurdistan-on-day-two-of-visit), where tensions remain high due to Iran's military strikes against Kurdish forces. The trip aims to enhance strategic cooperation between Iran and Iraq, focusing on regional stability

### Islamists See Gains in Jordanian Election

Jordan's main Islamist opposition party, the [Islamic Action Front (IAF)](https://www.dw.com/en/jordan-islamists-win-big-in-parliamentary-elections/a-70193770), made significant gains in this week’s parliamentary elections, securing 31 out of 138 seats. While not a majority, this marks the IAF’s most successful election to date. Voter turnout was low, attributed to economic challenges and discontent over the Gaza crisis.

The IAF, Jordan’s branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, gained traction partly due to its Palestinian origins, reflecting growing public frustration with Jordan’s handling of the Gaza conflict. Jordan, a key U.S. ally, balances its relationship with Israel against rising domestic pro-Palestinian sentiment.

### FOUNDATIONS

**EU VS EEA**

![EU and EEA in European trade and regulations](/images/eu-vs-eea-AzMD.webp)

**The European Union (EU)** and the **European Economic Area (EEA)** are both vital components of Europe’s economic framework, but they differ significantly in scope and structure.

The EU is a **political and economic union** made up of 27 countries, designed to encourage cooperation in areas like trade, law, security, and the free movement of people. In addition to a single market—which allows the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people—the EU also has its decision-making bodies, such as the European Parliament and the European Commission. These institutions set policies and create laws binding for all member states.

The EEA, on the other hand, is a **broader economic agreement** that includes the 27 EU countries and three non-EU nations: **Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein**. These countries are not part of the EU but still enjoy access to its single market. This allows them to trade freely and benefit from many of the same advantages as EU members without being involved in the political decision-making process. EEA members must adopt most EU regulations related to the market but have no say in shaping these rules.

One notable absence from the EEA is **Switzerland**, which has opted to stay out despite multiple bilateral agreements with the EU. While Switzerland participates in the single market in many areas, it negotiates individual terms rather than being part of a broader economic framework like the EEA.
