### Second Anniversary of Iran’s Women’s Movement

This weekend marks two years since the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd who died in police custody after being arrested for violating Iran's strict dress code. Her death on September 15, 2022, sparked widespread outrage and [protests](https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20240916-two-years-after-death-mahsa-amini-quiet-revolution-in-iran-women-protest-reformers), leading to the birth of the “Women, Life, Freedom” movement. The protests quickly spread across Iran and resonated globally, particularly in countries with significant Iranian diasporas, such as the US, Germany, France, and Norway.

The women-led protests in Iran, calling for greater freedom and rights, were met with brutal [crackdowns](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qgq919yl5o) by Iranian security forces. Many activists were killed or jailed, and the movement inside Iran was largely suppressed. However, women in Iranian prisons have started hunger strikes to commemorate Amini's death, keeping the spirit of resistance alive.

Over the weekend, demonstrations were held in major European and American cities, with activists showing solidarity with the Iranian women still fighting for their rights. The movement has drawn attention to the harsh realities faced by women in Iran. However, it has also sparked debates among Western activists about the complexities of supporting a cause in a country often seen as standing against US hegemony.

### US and South Korea Discus Cost-Sharing Deal for Troops

The US and South Korea are discussing a [cost-sharing agreement ](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qgq919yl5o)regarding the US troops stationed in South Korea. This comes as both nations prepare for the possibility of a Donald Trump presidency, during which Trump demanded Seoul pay up to 400% more for the [US military presence](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/02/asia/camp-humphreys-us-south-korea-dst-intl-hnk/index.html). The current deal is set to expire in December 2025, but some officials wanted to secure a new agreement in advance.

The US military presence is seen as vital to maintaining security in the region and deterring North Korean aggression. While some question the need for such a large presence, both South Korea and US advocates argue the alliance is crucial for stability.

### Iranian President to Attend BRICS Summit Amid Missile Allegations

According to the Iranian ambassador to Russia, Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian will attend the upcoming BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, from October 22nd to 24th. Iran officially became a BRICS member this year, aligning itself with countries like Russia and China to challenge Western influence.

Despite Iran being a new member of the bloc, the geopolitical implications are alarming to some in the West, as the situation with Iran and Russia has caused some problems in the last week. Iran is accused of giving Russia missiles for its war efforts in Ukraine. Although Iranian officials [denied](https://www.reuters.com/world/tehran-did-not-deliver-missiles-russia-foreign-minister-says-2024-09-11/) this, Russia was quiet about it.

### China Releases US Pastor After 18 Years

China has [released](https://duihua.org/dui-hua-welcomes-the-release-of-pastor-david-lin/) an American pastor who had been imprisoned for 18 years and allowed him to return home to Texas. He was serving a life sentence for helping establish an underground church in Beijing, a charge many believe was politically motivated.

China is known for its strict laws governing religious institutions and has long been suspicious of foreign influence in its religious sector. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan is believed to have negotiated the pastor's release during recent talks with China. Several [other US citizens](https://www.voanews.com/a/us-will-continue-to-push-for-release-of-detainees-in-china-state-department-says/7787144.html) remain imprisoned in China, including one on death row.

### West African Junta States Plan New Passport to Leave ECOWAS

Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, all now governed by military juntas, plan to introduce new biometric passports, removing the ECOWAS logo in favor of the [Sahel alliance](https://www.alliance-sahel.org/en/sahel-alliance/) emblem. This move signifies their intent to exit the 15-nation West African economic bloc, ECOWAS, which provides shared economic agreements and visa-free travel between member states.

[ECOWAS](https://www.ecowas.int/about-ecowas/) has warned the three nations of the economic and diplomatic consequences of leaving the bloc, which could further isolate them from regional cooperation. The Sahel alliance, composed of these three states, faces criticism for links to militant groups like al-Qaeda and Islamic State.

The [European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en) is the executive branch of the [European Union (EU)](https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/eu-countries_en), responsible for proposing laws, enforcing EU treaties, managing the EU’s budget, and representing the EU internationally. Composed of 27 commissioners, one from each member state, the Commission operates independently of national governments. Its president, currently Ursula von der Leyen, leads the organization.

The Commission plays a vital role in ensuring that EU policies are implemented across member states and supports international development and aid. Its focus is on six priorities: the Green Deal, digital transformation, economic resilience, social equity, the rule of law, and global leadership. The Commission serves as the engine of the EU, promoting the general interest of its citizens across diverse areas.
