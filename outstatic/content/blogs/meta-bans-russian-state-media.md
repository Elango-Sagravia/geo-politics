### Meta Bans RT and Other Russian Media Outlets

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has announced a global ban on Russia Today (RT) and other Russian state media, such as Rossiya Segodnya. All of these outlets will be banned globally from all of their apps. The social media company has written on its site that this is due to [foreign interference](https://www.newsweek.com/meta-ban-russian-news-moscow-propaganda-1955105). In the coming days, more details will be provided on how the ban will occur.

Meta and Russia have had a series of problems since the onset of the war in 2022. Facebook and Instagram are already blocked in Russia. Whatsapp, owned by Meta, isn’t banned or used by many, but it's much less popular than Telegram. Telegram has surpassed WhatsApp in terms of usage in Russia since the beginning of 2023.

The Kremlin spokesperson says these are very selective actions against Russia. Russian state media outlets have been an outgoing issue for American companies. A couple of weeks ago, Russia Today was linked to influencing the 2024 election [(See previous write-up)](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/turkey-seeks-brics). Supporters say this ban helps combat the outside influence of elections on social media. Some critics believe this could be a slippery slope and cause the subsequent ban of other state media outlets that do not shape a particular worldview in the future.

### Thousands of Pagers Explode in Lebanon

Hezbollah said that nine people were [killed](https://www.dw.com/en/lebanon-pagers-explosions-kill-several-injure-thousands/a-70241394) in Lebanon on Tuesday when handheld pagers exploded all over the country, leaving thousands more injured, including the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon. Over a dozen are injured in Damascus, Syria, where some pagers also went off. The main targets appear to be Hezbollah members.

The Lebanese government blames Israel and says they are trying to escalate things into starting a proper war with Lebanon. Israel hasn’t made a statement. Hezbollah is a militant political organization In Lebanon and Syria; similar to Hamas and Houthis, they are funded mainly by [Iran](https://www.newsweek.com/hamas-hezbollah-military-power-arsenals-1916769). Hezbollah and Israel have shared some drone attacks and firing over borders recently, but nothing yet on this scale.

### India Lashes Out At Iran

India has become frustrated with Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran’s supreme leader. Khomeini recently criticized India’s treatment of Muslims in India mainly; he [posted on X](https://x.com/khamenei_ir/status/1835646452699164752) equating India’s treatment of Muslims with how Israel treats Muslims. India has replied that Iran needs to look at itself and how minorities are treated there.

The underlying issue is India’s support towards Israel in the Israel-Gaza conflict. Indian and Iranian relations are satisfactory, but India’s role in this conflict indirectly contributes to the further regression in the Iranian-Indian relationship. India has a close [relationship](https://www.freiheit.org/south-asia/india-outs-its-israel-affair) with Israel; they share common security concerns regarding Islamic terrorism. This relationship wasn’t always the case; until the 1990s, India was geopolitically aligned with most Arab countries as part of the nonaligned movement.

### Democracy Is in Decline Worldwide

According to The Swedish Institute, International IDEA, the world had its worst decline in democracy in almost a half-century last year. This is part of an eight-year [trend](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/17/democracy-declined-for-8th-straight-year-around-the-globe-institute-finds-00179470) downward. The institute measures democratic performance in 158 countries annually. One notable criterion was elections. Global election turnout is dropping, and 1/3rd of 2023’s elections were contested.

According to the report, Africa and the Americas stabilized compared to their usual performance. Western Asia scored poorly, and Europe saw some of the most dramatic declines. However, this ranking looks at 2023. Next year's report could have a different outlook and new trends. [2024](https://www.undp.org/super-year-elections) is a super-election year for the planet. Half of the world’s population is expected to go to the polls by the end of 2024.

**Beauty Pageant Comes Between Nigeria and South African Relations**

South Africans and Nigerians are involved in a significant online [dispute](https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/features/2024/9/17/how-a-beauty-queen-became-the-face-of-south-africa-nigeria-tensions) stemming from a beauty pageant. Chidimma Adetshina, a woman with Nigerian parents, was a finalist in the Miss South Africa competition. She left and went on to take the crown for Miss Nigeria, where she’s also a citizen. This has brought about discussions that people of West African background in South Africa endure.

While beauty pageants are supposed to be apolitical and seen as separate from common political topics, these competitions often raise underlying contentious sociopolitical issues. Another prominent example is the [Miss Japan pageant](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68078061.amp), which has raised issues surrounding identity, the most recent being that earlier in 2024, a Ukrainian immigrant won, while ten years ago, a biracial woman won the pageant.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why do Russia And Ukraine both want Crimea?**

![Map showing Crimea's strategic location and significance to Russia and Ukraine](/images/why-do-russia-and-ukraine-have-a-conflict-over-crimea--E2Nj.webp)

Both Russia and Ukraine want Crimea for almost the same motivations. They want control of Crimea due to its strategic, historical, and economic importance. Crimea, located on the Black Sea, provides access to key shipping routes and military advantage, particularly for Russia, which has a significant naval base in Sevastopol. This peninsula gives regional influence and the ability to project power.

Historically, Crimea has been part of both Russian and Ukrainian territories. It was transferred from Russia to Ukraine in 1954 when both were part of the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, Crimea became part of independent Ukraine. However, many in Russia and the ethnic Russians in Crimea viewed it as historically Russian land, while the Crimean Tatars who are originally from there see it differently. Crimean Tatars see themselves more with Ukraine.

In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea following a controversial referendum sparking international condemnation. Ukraine and much of the world do not recognize this annexation, considering Crimea part of its sovereign territory. For both sides, losing Crimea means losing vital access to the Black Sea, economic opportunities from tourism, and valuable natural resources like oil and gas reserves in the region. This is why a little peninsula has become the focal point of Geopolitics.
