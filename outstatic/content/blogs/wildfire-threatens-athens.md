### South Korea and U.S. to Launch Major Military Drills Amid North Korean Threats

Next week, South Korea and the United States will kick off their annual joint military exercises, Ulchi Freedom Shield, focusing on countering North Korea's nuclear threats. Running from August 19-29, the drills will include computer simulations and live-fire exercises to enhance the allies' defensive capabilities. With participation from around 19,000 South Korean troops, the drills are expected to provoke a strong response from North Korea, which has labeled them as invasion rehearsals. This year’s exercises come at a time of heightened tensions as North Korea accelerates its weapons development and intensifies its hostile rhetoric toward Washington and Seoul.

### U.S. Reinforces Military Presence in the Middle East

In response to rising tensions in the Middle East, the U.S. is bolstering its military capabilities by deploying additional forces. The Pentagon announced the dispatch of the USS Georgia, a guided missile submarine, and the acceleration of the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, equipped with F-35C fighters, to reinforce the existing fleet. This move follows a conversation between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, where Austin reaffirmed America's commitment to defending Israel. The timeline for the arrival of these assets has not been disclosed, but they are expected to enhance U.S. military readiness in the region.

A raging wildfire near Athens has triggered evacuation orders for several towns north and northwest of the city, including Anatoli, Daou Penteli, Nea Penteli, and parts of Dione. The fires come amid a severe heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach 100 degrees in the coming days. Over 250 residents have been evacuated with the assistance of police, who have deployed around 380 officers to the affected areas. Greece's Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection has placed emergency responders on high alert, warning of an extreme fire risk in the Athens peninsula and Boeotia region as the country battles the escalating wildfire crisis.

### ICC Monitors Venezuela Amid Post-Election Crackdown

The International Criminal Court (ICC) is closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela following the nation's controversial July 28 presidential election. Security forces loyal to President Nicolás Maduro have detained over 2,000 individuals protesting or questioning the legitimacy of his third-term victory, which has been widely disputed. The office of ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan issued a statement emphasizing the importance of upholding the rule of law and protecting individuals from potential crimes under the Rome Statute. The ICC continues its investigation into the post-election violence, urging individuals with relevant information to submit evidence via an online portal. Meanwhile, Maduro has vowed to show "no mercy" to those challenging his regime.

### Islamic State Claims Responsibility for Kabul Explosion

The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for a deadly explosion in Kabul that killed at least one person and injured 11 others. The attack, which occurred in the Dashti Barchi neighborhood—a predominantly Shiite area repeatedly targeted by IS militants—was carried out using an explosive device planted in a minivan. The militant group stated that the attack specifically targeted members of Afghanistan's Shiite minority. The IS affiliate has been a persistent rival to the Taliban since they took control of Afghanistan in August 2021. The Taliban's police force is currently investigating the incident, which adds to a series of assaults by IS on Shiite communities across the country.

### Ethiopia's Economy in Turmoil as Currency Reform Sparks Inflation

Ethiopia faces economic upheaval after recent foreign exchange reforms led to a 60% drop in the birr’s value against the dollar. Businesses in Addis Ababa, like the Samra Hotel, now update prices hourly due to rampant inflation. Supermarkets hoard goods, and authorities raid warehouses to curb price hikes, but the situation remains dire. The IMF's $1 billion aid offers a glimmer of hope, yet experts warn that fixed-income earners are hit hardest. With the government struggling to manage the crisis, many Ethiopians' daily life is becoming increasingly unpredictable.
