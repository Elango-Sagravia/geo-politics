### US and Chinese officials meet

U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan [met](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-chinese-officials-wrap-up-talks-beijing-taiwan-fentanyl-2024-08-29/) Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Thursday after finishing three days of talks aimed at easing friction between the two world powers. Xi Jinping and Joe Biden are planning a phone call in the coming weeks. The talks did not go into the upcoming elections, but other topics were discussed, such as Taiwan, shared security, other global conflicts, and the situation with the South China Sea. The US and Chinese media have painted that these were productive conversations. US and Chinese relations are not at an all-time high, but China and the US still have a strategic relationship built on economic and security interests.

### UN concerned about nuclear safety with Ukraine and Russia

The UN recently voiced its concern regarding Nuclear safety in the Ukraine and Russia conflict. The Ukrainian presence in Kursk has raised more alarm bells. Kursk is home to a significant nuclear power plant. Kyiv has denied that any of the [drone strikes](https://www.politico.eu/article/un-international-atomic-energy-agency-rafael-grossi-nuclear-incident-russia-kursk-plant-drone-strikes-war-in-ukraine/) have come near the power plant. It isn’t only from the Ukrainians; they are concerned about it. Some incidents with the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from the Russian plant also caused some alarm. The issue with this new form of warfare around nuclear plants is something that has to be dealt with. Many people, mainly from Europe, shave the legacy of the Chornobyl meltdown in 1987 fresh in their heads.

### Maduro slams the EU

Venezuela's president, Nicolas Maduro, had some less-than-positive things to say regarding the European Union. The main person who caused his discontent was the EU’s top diplomat, Joseep Borell, who criticized Venezuela's [disputed election](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/08/28/venezuelas-maduro-accuses-borrell-of-complicity-in-gaza-war-as-tensions-with-eu-soar). The whole EU bloc primarily sides with the opposition candidate and questions the legitimacy of the election that happened last month. He said Borell supports the Palestinian holocaust and shouldn’t point his finger at Venezuela. He also said the EU is complicit and led astray in the US-backed proxy war with Ukraine and Russia. While Maduro’s presidency has caused more of a strain on US relations, it hasn’t been the high point for EU-Venezuelans relations either.

### Hong Kong convicts journalists of sedition

Hong Kong news editors Chung Pui-kuen and Patrick Lam were [found guilty](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240829-hit-my-heart-trial-of-hong-kong-editors-leave-journalists-in-tears) of "conspiracy to publish and reproduce seditious publications." Their website, which was in Chinese, became famous for covering Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests in 2019 and exposing the authorities were squashing the protests. In recent years, there have been more crackdowns on journalists and those showing discontent with the government, which many feel is in line with Beijing’s wishes. They also feel this is the end of the freedom of the press. Hong Kong is technically part of China under the One China policy but has been its autonomous region that functions as its own country, similar to Taiwan.

### India-Bangladesh relations in an awkward place

Bangladesh and India have managed to have good relations in a region that isn't famous for harmony. However, these relations have [reached a fork in the road](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/28/hasina-floods-visas-whats-troubling-india-bangladesh-relations) since the ousting of the most recent Bangladeshi prime minister, Hasina. Hasina's ousting has caused a lot of anti-Hindi sentiment in Bangladesh. Now, the provisional government wants India to extradite her to Bangladesh. Hasina’s opposition says that if India wants to maintain the relationship, it should respect its wishes. To make matters more complicated, India has been blamed by many in Bangladesh for causing the recent floods that have killed many people. Many believe this resulted from India’s deliberate opening of the Dumbur Dam, where much water comes to Bangladesh.
