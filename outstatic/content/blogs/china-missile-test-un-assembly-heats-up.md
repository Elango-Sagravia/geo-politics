### China Test Fires Ballistic Missiles Into Pacific

China test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean, raising regional security concerns. The missile, launched by the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force as part of annual training, carried a dummy warhead and landed in "expected sea areas," according to China's Defense Ministry.

Beijing claimed to have informed relevant nations, though Japan disputed this, saying no advance notice of the ICBM was given. Japan issued maritime warnings after being alerted to potential "space debris" but expressed concerns over transparency.

The missile test underscores China's growing military strength and adds to the ongoing geopolitical rivalry with the [U.S.](https://apnews.com/article/us-philippines-china-military-typhon-midrange-missile-system-69242b99335eb55032894fbc83d75135) and other Indo-Pacific nations like [Japan](https://apnews.com/article/japan-china-warship-disputed-islands-f6b715b0fcb580a9d812f85ad581ef55), [the Philippines](https://apnews.com/article/china-philippines-us-sea-clash-d08f4532c2a66047c6fa2833b76d7773), and [Taiwan](https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-military-drills-china-missiles-b769c85465b78db859bfc1c4c5e2e255), with whom China has territorial disputes.

### UN General Assembly Debates Stir Controversy

As geopolitical tensions rise, the UN General Assembly is amid its annual debates, and the first few days have already seen some controversial moments. Leaders like Joe Biden, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Iran’s Masoud Pezeshkian delivered speeches on day one.

While Biden and Pezeshkian remained relatively diplomatic, there was still plenty of sharp rhetoric. Zelensky [called out](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/25/zelenskyy-un-speech-russia-war-00180934) Iran, Brazil, and North Korea, while Erdoğan controversially [compared](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/27/turkeys-erdogan-says-netanyahu-no-different-than-hitler-as-gaza-is-bombed) Israel’s Prime Minister to Hitler. Smaller nations weighed in, too, with Denmark [criticizing](https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/denmark-s-pm-china-must-be-held-accountable-for-supporting-russia-in-ukraine-war/ar-AA1rciWT) China for supporting Russia. The debates continue until Monday, with Netanyahu set to speak on Friday.

### Slovak Prime Minister Threatened with Bullet in the Mail

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico received a death threat in the form of a bullet sent to him by mail. This incident follows a [previous assassination attempt](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/analysis/opinion-what-s-behind-assassination-attempt-on-slovak-prime-minister-robert-fico/3229089) in May that left him severely injured. The case has been handed over to police for investigation.

Fico has been accused of adopting authoritarian tactics, including targeting media and anti-corruption bodies, aligning with Hungary’s political approach. His pro-Kremlin stance on Ukraine has also generated criticism from both within Slovakia and across the EU.

### Hezbollah Strikes Tel Aviv as Israel Retaliates

Hezbollah launched a missile attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, marking a significant [escalation in the conflict](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/24/middleeast/israel-strikes-lebanon-hezbollah-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html). The missile, which targeted the Mossad intelligence agency, was intercepted by Israel's air defenses. This was the first time a Hezbollah missile had reached so close to Tel Aviv.

Israel retaliated by striking Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, while cross-border fire continued between the two sides. Israel did manage to kill a top [Hezbollah leader](https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-09-24-2024-640a0046aceea1b5cfb395a54ff36bce). Lebanese are fleeing Southern Lebanon. World leaders are becoming increasingly concerned about the escalation between Israel and Lebanon, as it is bringing regional instability.

### Blinken Faces Criticism Over Gaza Aid Block

A recent report revealed that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken ignored internal assessments from U.S. agencies that Israel was [blocking humanitarian aid](https://www.propublica.org/article/gaza-palestine-israel-blocked-humanitarian-aid-blinken) to Gaza. In April, USAID and the State Department’s refugee bureau reported Israeli restrictions on U.S. aid, but Blinken’s May report to Congress claimed there was no obstruction. This contradiction is significant, as U.S. law prohibits military aid to countries that block humanitarian assistance, and Israel receives billions in U.S. aid.

The situation has sparked criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. Blinken is accused of downplaying Israeli actions to maintain U.S. support, particularly as the Gaza conflict intensifies, fueling anger among Americans concerned about the ongoing humanitarian crisis and U.S. involvement.

**What is ETTIAS?**

![ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorization System)](/images/what-is-etias--I2Nj.webp)

[ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorization System)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias/what-etias_en) is a visa-waiver program implemented by the European Union. It requires non-EU citizens from visa-exempt countries, such as the United States, Canada, and Australia, to obtain travel authorization before entering the Schengen Area, which comprises most EU countries. ETIAS is designed to enhance security by pre-screening travelers for security, health, and immigration risks before they enter Europe.

Travelers must complete an online application, pay a fee, and provide personal information. The process is usually quick, and most applications are approved within minutes. Once granted, ETIAS authorization is valid for multiple short-term visits (up to 90 days within 180 days) over three years or until the passport expires.

The program is set to begin in mid-2025 after previous delays, with a potential grace period for travelers to adjust to the new system.
