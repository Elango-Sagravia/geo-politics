### Poland prepares for Trump

![Poland seeks U.K. alliance to support Ukraine](/images/polish-pm-makes-plans-to---trump-proof-g4OD.jpg)

Poland, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, is seeking to [ally](https://kyivindependent.com/polish-pm-to-hold-talks-with-leaders-of-uk-france-nato-on-protecting-ukraine-after-trump-victory/) with the U.K. to maintain support for Ukraine amid potential shifts in U.S. policy with Donald Trump's return to office in 2025. Trump has indicated a desire for a swift resolution to the conflict, which could involve Ukrainian concessions to Russia, and has not fully backed Ukraine's victory.

They hope to gain President Biden's approval for Ukraine to conduct deeper strikes into Russian territory using Western weapons, framing it as a significant legacy move. With Trump's administration potentially changing the [U.S. stance](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxrwr078v7o), Tusk worries that Ukraine's defeat would threaten Poland's security. Meanwhile, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell visited Kyiv to reaffirm European support, highlighting that the EU has provided [$125 billion in aid](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-donald-tusk-meet-eu-uk-leaders-nato-ukraine-after-donald-trump-win/) compared to the U.S.'s $90 billion.

### Japan reelects struggling PM

![Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba reelected despite coalition losses](/images/japan-s-parliament-MxOT.jpg)

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was [reelected](https://apnews.com/article/japan-politics-ishiba-cabinet-5945feb06a07730a98ebb3e0b46905bd) by parliament after his coalition suffered its worst election loss in over a decade. Due to financial misconduct scandals and a weak government response, the [coalition](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/historic-election-defeat-for-japan-s-ruling-party-what-next/3379725) lost its majority in the powerful Lower House. In the Nov. 11 session, Ishiba narrowly defeated opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda and reappointed most of his Cabinet, making a few changes to address the election fallout.

To maintain order and stability, Ishiba is willing to cooperate on policies with Yuichiro Tamaki‚Äôs Democratic Party for the People, which has gained popularity by advocating for economic reforms. However, Tamaki aims to remain independent, leveraging his party‚Äôs support for future influence. Ishiba faces challenges, including negotiating critical policies with the opposition, preparing for [Asia-Pacific summits](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Japan-PM-plans-to-attend-APEC-G20-summits-in-Peru-Brazil), and possibly meeting with President-elect Donald Trump later this month.

### Russian strikes

Russian strikes in Southern Ukraine [killed](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-updates-russian-strikes-kill-5-in-southern-regions/live-70749617) at least five civilians and injured 19 others in [Mykolaiv](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mykolaiv,+Mykolaiv+Oblast,+Ukraine,+54000/@46.9331807,31.8431901,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x40c5cb89fb7213d5:0x970e39fab9e05680!8m2!3d46.9660801!4d32.003246!16s%2Fg%2F122kzf92?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTEwNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) and [Zaporizhzhia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zaporizhzhia,+Zaporizhia+Oblast,+Ukraine,+69000/@47.8563415,35.0105468,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x40dc673dfa85bb03:0x7e675cd9074d3f4a!8m2!3d47.8392842!4d35.1387097!16zL20vMDYydDNy?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTEwNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). This follows Russia‚Äôs [weekend offensive](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241110-russia-says-it-downed-dozens-of-drones-in-biggest-ukrainian-attack-on-moscow-region), which included 145 drone launches in a single night, the largest nighttime assault since the conflict began, according to Ukrainian officials. In Kyiv, Ukraine issued an air alert after Russian Tu-95MS bombers launched, prompting power outages and sending residents to metro stations for shelter. While no missiles were ultimately fired, Ukrainian sources believe Russia may have simulated an attack.

Russian troops are attempting to [advance](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-troops-trying-advance-kursk-region-ukraine-says-2024-11-11/) into Ukrainian-held areas of the [Kursk region](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kursk+Oblast,+Russia/@51.6677647,34.9800862,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x412f0579d6594437:0xad02dfc2bf4338a8!8m2!3d51.7634026!4d35.3811812!16zL20vMDJmbmgx?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTEwNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), Ukraine‚Äôs General Oleksandr Syrskyi reported. Russia has gathered tens of thousands of soldiers along the border, aiming to push Ukrainian forces back from towns captured in August.

üá∫üá≤ **USA**: President-elect Donald Trump [reportedly discussed the Ukraine](https://www.dw.com/en/trump-talks-ukraine-in-separate-calls-with-putin-scholz/a-70749452) conflict with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a claim the Kremlin denies. Trump also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who reaffirmed Germany's support for Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is increasing military aid to bolster Ukraine before Trump‚Äôs inauguration on January 20. Scholz was willing to cooperate with Trump and highlighted Germany‚Äôs rise in defense spending to meet NATO standards, indicating cautious optimism for future collaboration despite Trump's past criticisms.

**üá≤üá∫ Mauritius**: Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth has [conceded](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/11/mauritius-pm-pravind-jugnauth-concedes-defeat-in-parliamentary) defeat in the parliamentary election, acknowledging a significant loss for his alliance, L‚ÄôAlliance Lepep. He expressed gratitude for his tenure and wished the incoming government success. Final results are pending, but opposition leader Navin Ramgoolam is expected to return as prime minister for a third term. Influenced by a wiretapping scandal and economic concerns, the election highlights rising living costs despite a stable economy. Ramgoolam, son of the first prime minister, is optimistic about addressing governance and corruption issues.

**Why did North Macedonia change the name?**

![North Macedonia added 'North' to its name in 2019 after the Prespa Agreement with Greece](/images/polish-pm-makes-plans-to---trump-proof-A3Mz.jpg)

North Macedonia is called that because of a [long-running dispute](https://www.euronews.com/2019/01/24/explained-the-controversial-name-dispute-between-greece-and-fyr-macedonia) with Greece over the name ‚ÄúMacedonia.‚Äù When the country declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 as the ‚ÄúRepublic of Macedonia,‚Äù Greece objected, arguing that ‚ÄúMacedonia‚Äù implied a claim on its northern region, also called Macedonia and holds historical solid significance for Greece.

After years of tense negotiations back and forth between both countries, they made a compromise known as the [Prespa Agreement](https://www.britannica.com/event/Prespa-Agreement). North Macedonia agreed to add ‚ÄúNorth‚Äù to its name, officially becoming the ‚ÄúRepublic of North Macedonia‚Äù in 2019. This change eased tensions, allowing North Macedonia to join NATO and advance its European Union membership bid, which Greece had previously blocked because of the name dispute. However, the change has felt like a blow to some citizens. Many do not approve of the change; even the new president wants to change the name back.
