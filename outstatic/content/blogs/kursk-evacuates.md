### Kursk residents evacuate

Ukrainian forces, as of Thursday, are still advancing in on the Russian city of Kursk. Over 133,000 people have left the Kursk region. Putin has accused Ukrainian forces of trying to destroy a power plant. The Kursk plant is one of Russia's top nuclear power stations. The governor says the situation is stable at the Kursk plant. The issue with power plants has become more apparent in this conflict. Both Eastern Ukraine and Western Russia hold several power plants. On the Ukrainian side, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has become the center of an ongoing nuclear safety crisis in the last two years.

### Update on Gaza 

Forty have died in the 24 hours from Israeli strikes in Gaza. Israeli military stepped up operations in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza and Khan Younis in the south. Israel announced evacuation orders in these parts early on Thursday evening. The death toll in Gaza is now estimated at over 40,000.  Delegations from all sides have now arrived in Cairo, Egypt, to continue ceasefire talks. US Secretary of State Blinken is still in the Middle East, putting pressure on all parties to agree to a ceasefire and hostage deal. Mainstream Democrats in the US have even called for ceasefires. However, many have said these calls were empty words.

Putin signed a decree this week establishing a new residency scheme for foreigners who disagree with their countries' policies and those who share “ traditional Russian values.” More provisions will follow later. This comes a week after an American family asked for temporary asylum because they felt traditional values were on the decline in the US. One thing distinct about this residency is that learning Russian is not compulsory. In most of the previous situations, this was a requirement for those of this sort who wanted to move to Russia. In 2023, Russia had planned to open a “ migrant village” outside of Moscow for conservative expat families. 

### Bangladesh unrest at the Indian border

Thousands of people from Bangladesh have been trying to flee to India since the protests and ousting of the Bangladeshi ex-prime minister. The Indian border is dealing with a number of these arrivals. One of the more significant concerns of the protestors is the safety of the Hindu people living in Bangladesh. There has been an uptick in the rise of anti-Hindu violence. The interim government intends to ensure equal rights for all ethnicities and religions. However, a lot of mobs are attacking Hindu villages and institutions. The situation with Bangladesh is becoming a more urgent issue for India to reckon with. 

### India reacts to Kamala Harris’s nomination

Kamala Harris officially secured the Democratic nomination on Wednesday night. However, they have been [celebrating](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/22/g-s1-18035/kamala-harris-india-ancestral-village) and praying for Kamala Harris nonstop in the mother's homeland since Joe Biden formally endorsed her last month. She has been a source of pride for many Indians, particularly Hindus. Her ancestral homeland celebrated her victory with music and firecrackers. They also put up giant, colorful billboards with her pictures. Some say she could be a unifying factor among the different religions of India. While many don’t know her official stances on foreign policy and how connected she is to the culture, they are mostly very proud of her.
