### Biden Pledges $567 Million Defense Package to Taiwan

The Biden administration has approved a $567 million defense aid package for Taiwan, marking the largest U.S. military support to the island to date. The funds will be used for defense equipment, services, and military education, following a previous package of $345 million last year. The move comes as part of Washington’s ongoing effort to strengthen Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities amid rising tensions with China, which views Taiwan as [part of its territory](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34729538).

While the U.S. officially adheres to the [“One China” policy](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-38285354), it maintains strong unofficial ties with Taiwan. This support has made Taiwan one of America’s closest partners in Asia, acting as a strategic buffer against China's growing influence. The latest military aid is expected to further strain U.S.-China relations, as Beijing criticized the move as a violation of international agreements​.

### Hezbollah Vows to Continue Fight After Nasrallah’s Death

Following the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an [Israeli airstrike](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/nasrallah-out-baltic-states-and-poland-want-more), the group’s acting leader, Naim Kassem, declared Hezbollah’s intent to continue its fight against Israel. Kassem confirmed that new leadership has already been put in place and warned that the group is prepared for a prolonged conflict. The escalation follows Israeli strikes in Lebanon that have resulted in hundreds of deaths, as well as Hezbollah’s retaliatory missile attacks, many of which have been intercepted by Israel’s [Iron Dome](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20385306) system.

The conflict is reverberating beyond Lebanon, with Israel now targeting Hezbollah positions in Syria and Yemen as well. International calls for a ceasefire have so far been unsuccessful, and the fighting threatens to spill over into other parts of the Middle East. The death of Nasrallah, a major figure in Hezbollah’s rise, further complicates the chances of peace in the region​.

### Russian Foreign Minister Wants to Work with Georgia 

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated that Russia is prepared to assist Georgia in normalizing relations with its breakaway regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This comes as part of Russia’s broader strategy to maintain influence in the Caucasus, where it supports these regions in defiance of Georgia’s territorial integrity. Georgia’s ruling party welcomed Lavrov’s statement, while opposition leaders criticized it as a ploy to keep Georgia from aligning with Western institutions like NATO and the EU.

Both [Abkhazia](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18175030) and [South Ossetia](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18269210) have been de facto independent since the early 1990s, with Russia backing their claims. The regions remain a thorn in Georgia’s efforts to integrate with the West, as unresolved territorial disputes are a major barrier to EU and NATO membership.

### Putin to Conscript 133,000 Soldiers Amid Ongoing War Effort

Russia's Defense Ministry plans to [draft](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/09/30/russian-military-to-draft-133k-conscripts-in-fall-call-up-a86517) 133,000 young men for mandatory military service this fall and winter. This comes after President Putin set a goal of 1.5 million active servicemen by the same time. They would be required to undergo compulsory military training, with penalties for avoiding service. Although conscripts can be deployed to combat zones after four months of training, the military has clarified that the newly drafted recruits will not be sent to Ukraine.

Criticisms have come about with Russia’s method of conscription in the past. Many critics have said little training was offered before sending them to Ukraine. Many of the conscripts have been disproportionately chosen from [ethnic minorities](https://www.newsweek.com/russian-army-racism-putin-war-mobilization-ethnic-minorities-1754274) from various regions in Eastern Russia, which has fanned some anti-Russian sentiment and regional nationalism, which wasn’t as strong before the Ukraine war.

### US Airstrikes in Syria

The U.S. military conducted two major [airstrikes](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/29/us-says-it-killed-37-isil-hurras-al-din-fighters-in-separate-syria-attacks) in Syria this month, killing 37 militants linked to ISIS and Al-Qaeda affiliates. The strikes, which occurred on September 16 and 24, targeted a training camp and militant hideouts, aiming to disrupt the groups’ operations in the region. These actions are part of the U.S. effort to prevent a resurgence of ISIS, which has been weakened but remains a threat to regional stability.

While Syria has faded from the headlines amid other global conflicts, it remains a focal point for U.S. military operations in the Middle East. With approximately 900 U.S. troops stationed in Syria, the goal is to prevent ISIS and similar groups from regaining a foothold. U.S. airstrikes continue to target militant networks while supporting Kurdish-led forces on the ground, ensuring that the region remains a priority in U.S. counterterrorism efforts​.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why does the US still use the Electoral College?**

![Electoral College map showing state-by-state vote distribution in U.S. presidential election](/images/why-does-the-us-still-use-the-electoral-college--A3MD.webp)

The [Electoral College](https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3701f.cp000001/?r=-0.28,0.088,1.588,0.723,0) is a unique system used to elect the President of the United States. Instead of relying on a direct popular vote, the U.S. assigns a certain number of electors to each state based on its representation in Congress. In most states, the candidate who wins the popular vote receives all of that state’s electoral votes. A total of 538 electoral votes are available, and a candidate must win 270 to secure the presidency.

The system was established in 1787 as part of the U.S. Constitution. It was designed as a compromise between electing the president by a popular vote and having Congress select the leader. The framers of the Constitution sought to balance power between smaller and larger states and provide a buffer against uninformed or manipulated public opinion. At the time, the Electoral College helped maintain the influence of less populous states while giving all states a role in the process.

Today, the Electoral College remains due to the difficulty of amending the Constitution, which would require approval from two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the states. Proponents argue that it ensures representation for all states, especially smaller ones, while critics claim it can lead to undemocratic outcomes. In five elections, including 2000 and 2016, candidates have won the presidency despite losing the national popular vote, fueling ongoing debates about whether the system should be reformed or abolished.
