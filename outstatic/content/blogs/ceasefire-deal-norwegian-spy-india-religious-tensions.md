### Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire

![](/images/more-on-the-ceasefire-between-hzebollah-and-israel-I5MT.webp)

The [ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2d3gj9ewxo) came into effect early Wednesday and has sparked a range of [reactions](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c2k0ezg2p3go). Some residents are cautiously optimistic but still note the devastation caused by the conflict, such as lost lives and destroyed homes. In Beirut, opinions on the ceasefire varied, with some expressing skepticism and calling for accountability and rebuilding. In Israel, reactions were mixed as well: some were hopeful for peace and the return of displaced residents; critics are fearing Hezbollah might regroup.

The ceasefire did not affect [Gaza](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0j8063plvdo), but US President Joe Biden expressed his wish that one would happen sooner rather than later. [Hamas](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hamas-says-group-ready-for-gaza-ceasefire-after-hezbollah-appears-to-lay-down-arms/) has also hinted it is ready for a ceasefire. The U.S. hopes the Lebanon truce, which ended 14 months of conflict, could pressure Hamas into concessions, though Israel‚Äôs goals in Gaza are broader and unresolved.

### Norwegian spy

The recent arrest of a 27-year-old Norwegian man on [espionage charges](https://apnews.com/article/us-russia-espionage-arrest-embassy-norway-arctic-9aabf55ae20cffc9082df002a9976e0a) for allegedly aiding Russia and Iran has sparked widespread concern and highlighted Norway‚Äôs strategic vulnerabilities. The suspect, employed as a security guard at the US Embassy in Oslo and linked to a dormant security company, is accused of collecting sensitive information that could threaten US interests.

His academic background in national security at the University of Tromso and visits to Kirkenes, near the Russian border, have intensified scrutiny, especially given the university‚Äôs connection to previous espionage cases like that of Russian spy [Mikhail Mikushin](https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/security/russia-prisoner-swap-includes-tromso-university-illegal-mikushin/165177). The arrest transpires against a backdrop of escalating espionage activity in Norway, including cases of Russian spies posing as diplomats and covert operations near NATO facilities. These developments emphasize the growing challenge of safeguarding national security in a region increasingly targeted by foreign intelligence services.

### Mosque survey dispute

Clashes in Sambhal, Uttar Pradesh, reveal the [rising tensions](https://www.dw.com/en/india-mosque-survey-dispute-erupts-into-deadly-clashes/a-70879085) over religious and historical disputes in India. This conflict stems from a court survey investigating claims that the Shahi Jama Masjid was built on the site of a Hindu temple, which angered many Muslims. This issue is similar to the [Ayodhya dispute](https://www.dw.com/en/india-modi-inaugurates-controversial-ayodhya-temple/a-68048499), where a Hindu temple was built on the ruins of a mosque.

Protesters who opposed the survey violently clashed with police, leading to four deaths. In response, authorities imposed curfews, banned gatherings, and shut down internet services to restore order. This incident highlights the increasing religious division in India. Critics say that the ruling party‚Äôs actions support claims that question the historical existence of mosques, worsening communal divides. The situation shows the delicate balance of secularism in India‚Äôs democracy and raises concerns about the growing marginalization of minority communities amid a rise in religious and political majoritarianism.

**üá∫üá∏ Mexico/Canada/China:** US President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs plan to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and 10% on China has [triggered strong opposition](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6kj2752jlo) from all three countries. Mexico‚Äôs President Sheinbaum warned of retaliatory tariffs, stressing that such measures wouldn‚Äôt fix migration or drug issues. Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau expressed concerns about the economic damage and vowed to respond if necessary. China rebuffed claims that it facilitated illegal drug trade and defended the mutually beneficial trade relationship: the proposed tariffs risk escalating trade, potentially damaging industries and economies in all four countries.

**üá∑üá∫ Russia:** A Russian court has ordered the [arrest](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241126-russian-court-orders-arrest-of-france-24-journalist-who-reported-from-kursk) of FRANCE 24 senior reporter Catherine Norris Trent, accusing her of illegally crossing into the Kursk region from Ukraine. The charge stems from her reporting on the Ukrainian army‚Äôs summer incursion into Russian territory. The court‚Äôs decision follows a broader crackdown on Western journalists, including those from CNN, RAI, and Deutsche Welle, who were embedded with Ukrainian forces in Kursk. Russia has initiated criminal proceedings against these reporters in absentia, warning that they will be arrested if they enter the country.\*\*

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is the heartland theory?**

![What is the Heartland Theory in geopolitics?](/images/what-is-the-heartland-theory_-UxMD.webp)

British geographer Halford Mackinder coined the [Heartland Theory](https://thegeographyteacher.com/mackinders-heartland-theory/) in the early 20th century. The theory argues that the key to global dominance lay in controlling the central region of Eurasia, which he called the ‚ÄúHeartland.‚Äù This area, which covered Eastern Europe, Russia, and parts of Central Asia, was seen as strategically vital due to its size, resources, and location. Mackinder‚Äôs famous quote was, ‚ÄúWho rules East Europe commands the Heartland; Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island; Who rules the World-Island commands the World.‚Äù

He emphasized land power over naval power, suggesting that controlling the Heartland would allow a nation to dominate Europe and Asia. The theory shaped Cold War strategies, particularly regarding Soviet expansion. It is criticized and labeled outdated because air travel, technology, and economic power have lessened the importance of controlling land. Nevertheless, it remains influential in geopolitical studies today.
