### North Korea warning

North Korea [test-fired](https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-missile-launch-377c07eac46ad41bda0d4445df6f51d5) its first intercontinental ballistic missile [(ICBM)](https://www.britannica.com/technology/ICBM) in nearly a year, signaling potential advancements in its nuclear capabilities. The launch, observed by Kim Jong Un, was a show of strength amid [tensions](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgw8vq2xxyo) with the U.S. and South Korea. Experts speculate that Russia may have provided technical assistance for this launch, especially following North Koreaâ€™s reported troop dispatch to support Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine [(see our write-up)](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/unwra-banned-in-israel-north-korean-troops-in-russia-chad-attacked). The missile reportedly achieved a flight duration of 86 minutes and a maximum altitude exceeding 7,000 kilometers.

North Korea has gradually increased its global presence. Many are worried about its involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war. South Korea is now [contemplating sending troops](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/24/nx-s1-5163246/south-korea-weapons-ukraine-north-korea-troops-russia) to help Ukraine. South Koreaâ€™s President Yoon emphasized that South Korea would not remain passive against threats to global security. Some wonder if this could set a precedent for a smaller-scale global war.

### White House in Israel

Senior U.S. officials are in the Middle East to [negotiate a ceasefire](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14ln6kkkg7o) between Israel and Hezbollah. Discussions are ongoing, with the Lebanese Prime Minister expressing cautious optimism. A draft agreement suggests a 60-day ceasefire, during which Israel would withdraw forces from Lebanon, and Hezbollah would cease its armed presence. However, Israel seeks assurances about Hezbollahâ€™s compliance, complicating negotiations.

There hasnâ€™t been a stop in the violence. Thursday saw attacks from Israel and Hezbollah, resulting in casualties on [both sides](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/10/31/live-israel-pounds-gaza-lebanon-amid-hopes-of-a-truce-with-hezbollah). U.S. officials are also aiming for a deal involving hostages in Gaza. Success towards reaching a ceasefire hostage deal has been unsuccessful in the last attempts. Secretary of State Anthony Bliken has visited the Middle East [eleven times](https://apnews.com/article/us-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-blinken-c450119702081057ff6c816d6a19e51a) in just over a year.

### Europe favors Harris

A recent poll reveals that Europeans would [favor Kamala Harris](https://www.dw.com/en/us-election-2024-why-the-eu-wants-kamala-harris-in-the-white-house-v2/a-70644670) if they could vote in the upcoming U.S. election. In Western Europe, 69% of respondents support Harris, and 46% in Eastern Europe also back her. Trump finds his most substantial support in Hungary and Serbia, where right-wing leaders value his foreign policy approach, especially concerning Ukraine and reducing U.S. involvement. Hungarian Prime Minister [Viktor Orban](https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-viktor-orban-wished-donald-trump-good-luck-in-phone-call-us-elections-2024/), a Trump supporter, believes Trumpâ€™s policies could quickly end the Ukraine war.

Most EU leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, support Harris because of her stability and commitment to transatlantic cooperation. They view her as a more predictable leader who aligns with Europe on many global issues, such as security and support for Ukraine. A Trump presidency would be less predictable. If Trump reimposes trade tariffs or alters NATO commitments, European officials actively plan economic and diplomatic strategies to protect their interests. Regardless of the outcome, leaders expect the U.S. to ask Europe to shoulder more responsibility for its defense and economic security.

**ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ Mexico:** Eight of the eleven justices on Mexicoâ€™s Supreme Court have [resigned](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/31/americas/mexico-justices-resign-judicial-reform-intl-hnk/index.html) ahead of a June election mandated by a recent [constitutional reform](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/10/americas/mexico-judicial-reform-debate-senate-intl-latam/index.html) requiring judges to be elected by popular vote. The resignations heighten tensions between the court and the ruling government, with some justices emphasizing that their departures do not imply acceptance of the reformâ€™s constitutionality. Due to this overhaul, the courtâ€™s membership will decrease from eleven to nine justices.

**ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¹ Lithuania:** Vilija Blinkeviciute, the leader of Lithuaniaâ€™s victorious Social Democrats, announced that she would [not assume the role](https://www.politico.eu/article/lithuania-election-winner-refuses-prime-minister-vilija-blinkeviciute/) of prime minister, citing concerns about her age and health. At nearly 65 years old and a pensioner, she expressed doubts about her ability to fulfill the demanding responsibilities of the position. Instead, she endorsed [Gintautas Paluckas](https://pace.coe.int/en/members/8360/paluckas), a former party leader, as the best candidate for prime minister. Blinkeviciute prefers to continue serving as a [Member of the European Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/96681/VILIJA_BLINKEVICIUTE/home) (MEP) instead of taking a seat in Lithuaniaâ€™s parliament.

**Why Russia sold Alaska**

![Russia sold Alaska to the U.S. for $7.2 million, fearing a British takeover and seeking to ease economic burdens](/images/alaska-MwMj.jpg)

Russia sold Alaska to the U.S. on March 30, 1867, for $7.2 million, a move that some called "[Seward's Folly](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/sewards-folly)" after Secretary of State William H. Seward, who brokered the deal. Russia was worried about its ability to defend Alaska at the time and feared the British could easily take it if a war broke out. They also wanted to offload the economic burden of maintaining the territory.

The sale of Alaska had various responses; while some critics regarded it as a misguided investment, it soon proved to be an extraordinary bargain. This was especially true when significant deposits of gold and other valuable resources were uncovered, transforming perceptions of the territory. Today, Alaska is celebrated for its vast natural wealth and holds considerable strategic importance.
