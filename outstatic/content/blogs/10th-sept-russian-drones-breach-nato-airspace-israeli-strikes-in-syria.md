### Russian Drones Enter NATO Airspace Over Latvia and Romania

Russian drones entered two different NATO members’ airspace on Sunday. Romania and Latvia shared reports within a few hours of each other. Romania first reported this on Sunday morning. Latvia’s defense reported that an explosive Russian drone crashed in Eastern Latvia [from Belarus](https://www.politico.eu/article/latvia-russia-drone-belarus-war-airspace-f16-jets/). Latvia posted a big fat warning on its defense ministry website stating that Latvia is a NATO member.

Romania had this happen a couple of times over the summer from Russia’s bombing of Odesa.

Odessa is close geographically to Romania in the grand scheme of things. Romania has seriously addressed this threat, but the Baltic states are more firm in warning that this does not happen again. The Baltic States have a complex history with Russia, making them less likely to want to mess around in the event of another accident.

The Russian drones entering NATO airspace appear to be accidental rather than deliberate provocations. A deliberate attack on NATO territory would likely trigger significant consequences, given NATO’s collective defense agreements. Russia is currently focused on its military operations in Ukraine, which have been ongoing for nearly three years. Engaging in direct conflict with a NATO member would escalate tensions significantly, making such an action unlikely.

### Israeli Strikes in Syria Kill 18, Target Military and Research Sites

The casualties from the [Israeli airstrikes](https://apnews.com/article/israel-syria-strikes-hama-iran-hezbollah-916f12c8f1fae066439733c2c0ba9980) in Syria rose to 18 on Monday. This is the most significant death toll in Syria since the conflict in Gaza. Israel often attacks Military sites in Syria linked to Hezbollah. On Sunday, it was not just military sites but also a research center that allegedly focuses on the development of weapons. Israel hasn’t given a statement yet.

Israel has had more issues with Hezbollah in the last few months. Israel has exchanged strikes back and forth with Syria and Lebanon, most of the time with limited casualties on both sides. The primary strategy of the Israeli military is to contain Iranian proxy groups in the Middle East, such as Hezbollah and Hamas.

### German Intelligence Accuses Moscow of Cybercrimes

German domestic intelligence has issued a warning involving a Russian [cybercrime group](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-blames-russian-gru-unit-for-eu-nato-cyberattacks/a-70167641) that belongs to Russian Military intelligence and is behind multiple cyber crimes in Germany. The main targets in Germany are against the ruling Social Democrats (SPD) and other German companies from various factions. The attacks involved stealing and publishing sensitive data.

The group is also accused of attacking networks in NATO member states in Europe and North America, as well as countries in Latin America and Central Asia. Many claim Russian intelligence launched cyber attacks toward political parties and movements that are“ less Russian friendly.” The ruling German Social Democrat Party ticks these boxes.

### EU Investigates Iran’s Alleged Supply of Ballistic Missiles to Russia

EU officials claim they have credible [evidence](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240909-eu-aware-of-claims-iran-sent-missiles-to-russia-denied-by-tehran) that Iran is sending Russian ballistic missiles. They are looking more into the reports from the allies to decide on the appropriate course of action. Iran denies this claim. Russia has said nothing. Ukraine says it has been attacked with Iranian-designed Shahed drones on an almost daily basis from Russia.

The report of the delivery of missiles to Russia comes at a time when the Kremlin has amped up its bombing in Ukraine. Iran and Russia have been strategic allies since the fall of the Soviet Union and have recently become closer over the Western sanctions placed on both of them in the last couple of years.

### Tanzanian Opposition Leader Kidnapped and Murdered

A senior member of Tanzania’s opposition party was found dead under [harrowing circumstances](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/9/slain-tanzanian-opposition-figure-beaten-doused-with-acid-party), with an autopsy revealing that he was severely beaten and had acid poured on his face. He was last seen on Friday when security agents reportedly took him off a bus in the capital, Dar Es Salaam. Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan has condemned the murder and called for a thorough investigation.

The U.S. embassy in Tanzania has also urged for an independent and transparent inquiry into the killing. Human rights groups have expressed growing concern over Tanzania's political climate, warning that increasing crackdowns on dissent are testing the country's democratic integrity. Recent incidents, including the imprisonment of an artist for two years for burning a picture of the president, underscore the rising tensions surrounding free speech and political opposition in Tanzania. While the government has pledged to investigate, many worry that these actions are part of a broader pattern of political repression.
