### Sabotage charges

![](/images/russia-arrests-german-citizen-on-sabotage-charges--1--kzMz.jpg)

Russian authorities have detained a 57-year-old German citizen [accused](https://www.dw.com/en/russia-arrests-german-citizen-on-sabotage-charges/a-70827990) of organizing sabotage and a March 2024 gas station explosion in Kaliningrad. The man in question was arrested at the Kaliningrad border with potential explosives in his car. He is allegedly linked to Ukrainian directives. Germany‚Äôs Foreign Ministry confirmed consular contact but has refrained from commenting on the charges or giving further details.¬†

This arrest adds to tensions between Russia and Western nations, with allegations of politically motivated cases following the Ukraine conflict. Germany is one of the EU nations with a rather pragmatic and constructive [relationship](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2018/05/russia-and-germany-from-estranged-partners-to-good-neighbors?lang=en&center=russia-eurasia) with Russia in the 1990s and 2000s. They were not without problems or cozy, but German leadership understood the need for this cooperation; however, relations between the two soured after the [annexation of Crimea](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine/The-crisis-in-Crimea-and-eastern-Ukraine) and continued to deteriorate with the 2022 war in Ukraine.¬†

### Marco Rubio strategy

![](/images/how-rubio-is-expected-to-take-on-us--latam-relations--2--E5NT.jpg)

If confirmed by the Senate, Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, would be the first Latin-American [Secretary of State](https://apnews.com/article/marco-rubio-trump-latin-america-secretary-of-state-87aff0ce93f638fb69e30b067ecd84fb). While Hispanic voter dynamics are changing, Cuban Americans tend to be more [politically conservative](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/18/florida-miami-cuban-americans-republicans) than other Hispanic voters. This could be telling how Rubio will form his strategy for Latin America. At the moment, Rubio plans to refocus U.S. foreign policy on Latin America, emphasizing an anti-communist agenda and countering adversarial influences like China and Russia.¬†

Rubio‚Äôs approach may strain relations with some governments reluctant to align with the U.S., such as Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua, prioritizing sanctions and diplomatic pressure. Rubio‚Äôs track record on migration and his critique of regional leftist leaders underscore his polarizing, security-focused strategy for U.S. relations in the hemisphere. He could also bring unity among countries with far-right leadership, such as [Argentina](https://english.elpais.com/usa/elections/2024-11-18/marco-rubio-a-hawk-on-latin-america-from-attacking-the-narco-dictatorship-in-venezuela-to-welcoming-his-friend-javier-milei.html), which is willing to align with the U.S.¬†

### Embassies close in Kyiv

The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has [temporarily closed](https://www.newsweek.com/us-embassy-kyiv-closes-attack-threat-russia-ukraine-war-latest-1988714) due to specific intelligence indicating a potential significant Russian airstrike. Embassy personnel have been instructed to shelter in place, and U.S. citizens in Ukraine are urged to stay informed, find nearby shelters, and be prepared to act quickly during air alerts. Several European nations, including Italy, Spain, and Greece, have closed their Kyiv embassies.

This closure comes amid tensions following the U.S. [approval](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20241119-us-approval-for-ukraine-missile-strikes-into-russia-is-a-slim-lifeline-for-kyiv-1) for Ukraine to use American weaponry to strike Russian territory. In response, Moscow has escalated its rhetoric and revised its [nuclear doctrine](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4v0rey0jzo) to lower the threshold for deployment in reaction to conventional threats. Additionally, reports indicate that Russian missile and drone strikes have intensified across Ukraine as winter approaches, targeting critical infrastructure and resulting in civilian casualties, such as a recent attack in Sumy.

**üáÆüá± Israel:** Benjamin Netanyahu has announced a [$5 million reward](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/20/israeli-pm-netanyahu-offers-five-million-reward-for-captives-freed-from-gaza) for anyone who aids in the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. He also claims that anyone who assists in releasing them will be assured safe passage. This policy comes amid ongoing protests in Israel by families of captives demanding a ceasefire deal, which Netanyahu has not been receptive to. Analysts suggest that Netanyahu‚Äôs reluctance to end the Gaza war is influenced by political concerns, including the stability of his government and investigations into his administration‚Äôs pre-war failures. Israel‚Äôs military has vowed to eliminate Hamas governance in Gaza.

**üá¨üáß UK:** The U.K.‚Äòs decision to [transfer sovereignty](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-david-lammy-donald-trump-dont-worry-about-chagos-islands-deal-marco-rubio-us/) of the [Chagos Islands](https://www.google.com/maps/place/British+Indian+Ocean+Territory/@-6.3102556,70.5674504,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x249273e0849da387:0xa94f6470101f6be1!8m2!3d-6.343194!4d71.876519!16zL20vMDE2OGI?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) to Mauritius while keeping [Diego Garcia](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckdg7jjlx2go)‚Äôs military base under joint U.K.-U.S. control has sparked controversy. U.S. Republicans, including Marco Rubio, argue that the move could threaten U.S. regional security and empower China. However, British Foreign Minister David Lammy expressed confidence that President-elect Trump will support the agreement, emphasizing the importance of maintaining control over the naval base to secure global security and deter Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is the Chagos Island deal?**

![](/images/chagos-islands-MwMD.webp)

The ‚Äú[Chagos Islands deal](https://theweek.com/politics/the-chagos-agreement-explained)‚Äù refers to the recent agreement by the United Kingdom to transfer the sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius. This decision attempts to solve a long-standing dispute over the islands, which Mauritius claims were unfairly taken by the UK in exchange for its [independence](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mauritius/Independence) in 1968. The deal was shaped by a [2019 advisory opinion ](https://www.icj-cij.org/index.php/node/105778)from the International Court of Justice, which states that the British administration of the islands should end.

The Chagos Archipelago includes Diego Garcia, a critical site for a joint US-UK military base. Under the agreement, Diego Garcia will remain under UK and US control for at least 99 years, preserving its strategic military importance in the Indian Ocean. However, the deal has faced criticism, with some in the [US](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-chagos-islands-uk-british-us-president-mauritius-london/) and UK expressing concerns that it could compromise security and bolster China‚Äôs influence in the region.
