### Nasrallah Dead: World and Lebanon Divided

Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s long-time leader, was killed in an Israeli airstrike over the weekend, sending shockwaves across the Middle East. Hezbollah honored Nasrallah as a martyr, while Israel celebrated the elimination of a [key figure](https://x.com/Israel/status/1839939956854132917) they accused of orchestrating numerous attacks. Iran vowed to support Hezbollah in retaliation, raising concerns of increased violence in Lebanon and beyond. The U.S. and EU welcomed Nasrallah's death but urged for diplomacy to prevent an escalation of the conflict.

Lebanon remains deeply divided following Nasrallah’s death. Many Lebanese fear further Israeli strikes and the potential destabilization of their country, while others hope his death could weaken Hezbollah’s influence. Nasrallah’s demise adds yet another layer of complexity to an already volatile situation, threatening to spill over into broader regional tensions involving Iran, Israel, and other major powers.

### Baltic States and Poland Push for EU Defense Funds

![Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland](/images/estonia--latvia--lithuania-and-poland-want-eu-funds-to-beef-up-border-with-russia-IzOT.webp)

Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland are requesting additional EU funding to strengthen their defense lines against Russia and Belarus. The proposed [“Baltic Defense Line”](https://www.fpri.org/article/2024/02/the-baltic-defense-line/) would consist of fortified bunkers, barriers, and military storage facilities along their borders, aiming to deter any potential aggression from Moscow. These countries are among the strongest advocates for NATO’s presence in Europe and have ramped up defense spending since Russia invaded Ukraine.

The request for EU funds highlights the increasing militarization of Eastern Europe, where concerns over Russian expansionism continue to grow. Poland, which has already significantly increased its [defense budget](https://www.statista.com/statistics/584088/defense-expenditures-of-nato-countries/#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20Poland's%20defense%20spending,percent%20in%20the%20previous%20year.), is expected to complete its defense line by 2028, while Estonia aims to start construction in 2025. This fortification plan plays into NATO’s broader strategy of forward defense in Europe and is likely to receive substantial backing from Brussels.

### Moldova Accuses Russia of Election Interference

Moldova’s government has accused Russia of actively interfering in its upcoming referendum on EU membership and the presidential election, set for October 20. According to Moldovan officials, Russia is using a combination of disinformation, illicit funding, and social media manipulation to sway public opinion. Moldova’s national security adviser claims that Moscow has funneled up to €100 million to opposition parties in a bid to weaken pro-EU [President Maia Sandu](https://x.com/sandumaiamd?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)’s chances of success.

Moldova’s EU candidacy, granted last year, has heightened tensions with Moscow, which continues to back the breakaway region of [Transnistria](https://www.geopolitics.world/archives/iranian-president-speak). Backed by Russia, Transnistria declared independence from Moldova in the early 1990s, leading to an ongoing frozen conflict. This unresolved territorial dispute poses a significant challenge to Moldova’s EU membership aspirations, as the European Union requires all candidate countries to settle any territorial issues before joining. The general public of Moldova is polarized between the EU and Russian spheres of influence.

### Marine Le Pen on Trial

Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s National Rally, is [on trial](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240930-france-s-marine-le-pen-goes-on-trial-in-much-awaited-eu-embezzlement-case) for allegedly embezzling EU funds. Along with 26 other party officials, Le Pen is accused of misappropriating parliamentary assistant funds for party expenses, a charge she denies. If convicted, Le Pen could face up to 10 years in prison and heavy fines, potentially barring her from running for office.

The trial comes as Le Pen is considered a top contender in the 2027 French presidential race. Despite the allegations, Le Pen remains popular among far-right voters, and her legal troubles may even galvanize her base. Regardless of the trial’s outcome, the far-right in France is unlikely to lose momentum, with other leaders ready to step in if Le Pen is disqualified.

### Japan Set to Get a New PM

Japan’s ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has chosen former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba as its new leader, positioning him as the next [prime minister](https://apnews.com/article/japan-election-new-prime-minister-ca3ba06b79c79d5dc534a0d259a7272c). Ishiba’s victory comes after defeating Sanae Takaichi, a conservative candidate, in a party election. This leadership change is vital as the LDP controls Japan’s parliament, making the party leader the automatic choice for prime minister.

Ishiba, known for his defense expertise and centrist views, aims to strengthen Japan’s security and continue reforms initiated by outgoing Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. He also promotes a more balanced Japan-U.S. alliance. He has assertive views on U.S.-Japan security, including revising troop agreements and amending Japan's pacifist constitution, which could disrupt relations, making him a challenging figure for [U.S. interests](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/09/29/japans-prime-minister-ishiba-00181546).

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is the Montreal Protocol?**

![Montreal Protocol](/images/_-what-is-the-montreal-protocol--kxMj.webp)

The [Montreal Protocol](https://www.unep.org/ozonaction/who-we-are/about-montreal-protocol) is an international treaty established in 1987 to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production and consumption of substances that deplete it, particularly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). This agreement marked a significant global commitment to environmental protection, bringing together nations to address a critical issue affecting the Earth’s atmosphere.

The Protocol has been amended to include updates on newly discovered harmful substances, and its success has led to significant recovery of the ozone layer, which is projected to return to its pre-1980 levels by around 2060. Over 99% of ozone-depleting substances have been eliminated from the atmosphere.

The Montreal Protocol serves as a model of practical global cooperation in combating environmental challenges, contributing to broader efforts against climate change. It’s one of the most successful agreements of its kind. Its success is attributed to the overall scientific consensus, cooperation at the global level, and flexible framework.
