### Syria loses Aleppo

![Syria loses Aleppo](/images/syria--update-A3Mj.webp)

The conflict in northern Syria has [escalated](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/01/middleeast/syrian-regime-airstrikes-opposition-forces-intl/index.html) after a surprise offensive from the rebel alliance. This attack resulted in the control of a major military base east of [Aleppo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PrEZeEJZeh92ufuX6) and substantial areas of Aleppo and Idlib regions. The alliance, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and supported by Turkey and other Western-backed groups, [set foot](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/29/world/syria-rebels-aleppo-war-intl/index.html?iid=cnn_buildContentRecirc_end_recirc) in Syria‚Äôs second-largest city for the first time in eight years. This violence has led to at least 327 deaths, including civilians.

President Bashar al-Assad vowed to protect Syria‚Äôs stability and to eliminate all ‚Äúterrorists and their supporters‚Äù during a public speech. After that, Syrian and Russian jets launched a strike on the rebels to curb their advances. While the army denies killing any civilians, the [White Helmets](https://whitehelmets.org/), a Syrian humanitarian organization, claimed that the strike killed 12 civilians and injured 23. However, analysts suggest that the conflict dynamics are shifting, with Turkey becoming a critical player and Russian influence waning. This renewed violence complicates alliances amid its prolonged civil war, which has already [claimed](https://www.syriahr.com/en/291981/?doing_wp_cron=1733107927.6338100433349609375000) over 600,000 lives and displaced millions.

### Tbilisi mass demonstrations

![Mass demonstrations in Tbilisi, Georgia](/images/tbilisi-mass-demos-MzNj.webp)

For the fourth consecutive night, thousands of Georgians [protested](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp878819l8wo) in Tbilisi against the government's decision to delay European Union membership talks. Clashes erupted when the protestors aimed fireworks towards the parliament. Police used tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannons at demonstrators. Protesters erected barricades and burned an effigy of [Bidzina Ivanishvili,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/27/who-is-bidzina-ivanishvili-the-shadowy-billionaire-founder-of-georgian-dream) founder of the ruling Georgian Dream party. This is the largest protest since October's [contested parliamentary elections](https://apnews.com/article/georgia-election-protest-opposition-eu-russia-9620f502bf500de38f32c148c657fc4c). Some protesters, police officers, and a media worker were hospitalized. The authorities labeled the protests as ‚Äúviolent‚Äù and threatened legal action.

Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze defended the police response despite international [criticism](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_24_6161) from the U.S. and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. As many displayed EU flags, EU membership remains a famous aspiration among Georgians. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili has [supported](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy5ypkn7kjo) the protestors and called for new elections.

### Trump on tariffs

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago amid tensions over Trump‚Äôs [threat](https://time.com/7199118/canadian-prime-minister-trudeau-flies-to-florida-to-meet-with-trump-after-tariffs-threat/) to impose a 25% tariff on Canadian goods, citing migration and drug concerns. While the details of the three-hour dinner remain unknown, an anonymous official said the topics included trade, border security, NATO, Ukraine, and more. Trudeau, emphasizing Canada‚Äôs deep economic ties with the U.S., suggested that he would successfully negotiate the North American [trade pact](https://www.trade.gov/usmca-overview).

Canada, the top export destination for 36 U.S. states, is preparing potential retaliatory measures, though no decisions have been made. US-Canada dialogue is vital as 77% of Canadian exports depend on the U.S. market.

Meanwhile, Trump's tariffs target BRICS nations, [threatening](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/30/politics/trump-brics-currency-tariff/index.html) 100% tariffs unless they abandon plans for a currency that could challenge the U.S. dollar. He declared on Truth Social that attempts to undermine the dollar would face severe trade consequences.

**üáπüáº Taiwan:** Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te is [visiting](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/29/asia/taiwan-president-us-hawaii-hnk-intl/index.html#:~:text=Taiwan%20President%20Lai%20Ching-te%20will%20visit%20Hawaii%20and,round%20of%20military%20drills%20near%20the%20island%20democracy.) the United States for a seven-day tour to strengthen ties with Taiwan‚Äôs allies and promote international cooperation. This trip includes ‚Äúmeet with old friends‚Äù and closed-door talks with diplomats. China has condemned the visit and believes it is a step toward Taiwanese independence. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has warned against actions it perceives as challenging its sovereignty, further intensifying cross-strait tensions.

**üá∫üá¶ Ukraine:** Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has [proposed](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8g8ylvyldo) that NATO membership should include all of Ukraine, even territories currently under Russian control, to ensure security and end the war. In an interview with *Sky News*, he stated that Ukraine could seek to reclaim these areas diplomatically if NATO membership was offered for its internationally recognized borders. Zelensky rejected limiting NATO membership to only parts of Ukraine, as it would validate Russian claims to other regions. Although discussions about a "[West Germany model](https://kyivindependent.com/as-signs-of-talks-about-west-germany-model-for-ukraine-peace-emerge-experts-weigh-in-on-feasibility/)" of partial membership exist, no formal offers have been made, and NATO involvement seems unlikely.

**What is Greenland‚Äôs relationship with Denmark?**

![Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmar](/images/greenland-kxMj.webp)

Greenland is an [autonomous territory](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18249474#:~:text=Greenland%20is%20the%20world's%20largest,government%20and%20its%20own%20parliament.) within the Kingdom of Denmark. While it is geographically part of North America, it has been politically associated with Denmark since 1721. Over the years, Greenland has gained increasing self-governance, culminating in the Greenlandic Self-Government Act of 2009, which granted the island full control over most domestic affairs, including education, health, and natural resources. However, Denmark still controls foreign affairs, defense, and monetary policy.

This arrangement shapes Greenland‚Äôs relationship with Denmark, with Greenland having its parliament (the Inatsisartut) and government (the Naalakkersuisut). However, Denmark continues providing financial support to Greenland, as the island‚Äôs economy heavily depends on Danish subsidies. Greenland also represents Denmark in some international forums. Still, it has been exploring [independence options](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/greenland-unveils-draft-constitution-in-push-for-complete-independence-from-danish-control) in recent years, particularly in response to its vast natural resources and changing geopolitical dynamics, including the impacts of climate change on Arctic shipping routes.

Despite this growing autonomy, Greenland has not pursued complete independence, as the island‚Äôs population is divided. Economic considerations, such as reliance on Danish funding, play a significant role in maintaining the current relationship. However, there is a robust [independence movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgcd41yhiB8&themeRefresh=1).
