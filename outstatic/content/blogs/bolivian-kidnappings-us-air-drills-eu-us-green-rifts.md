### Bolivian soldiers held hostage

Armed supporters of Boliviaâ€™s former president, Evo Morales, have reportedly [taken control](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c937kekx3nqo) of a military facility near Cochabamba, holding at least 200 soldiers hostage. The Bolivian foreign ministry confirmed that the group seized weapons and ammunition, escalating tensions linked to ongoing blockades organized by Moralesâ€™ followers.

The recent hostage situation in Bolivia reveals the rising tensions between former President Evo Morales and current President Luis Arce. Morales and Arce, rivals within Boliviaâ€™s ruling [MAS party](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Movement-Toward-Socialism-political-party-Bolivia), are expected to compete in the [2025 presidential election](https://www.usip.org/publications/2024/06/can-bolivia-avoid-renewed-election-violence-2025), which has intensified internal conflicts and public unrest. The governmentâ€™s response and the ability to resolve this situation peacefully will be critical in the coming days.

### US-South Korea air drill

![South Korea, Japan, and U.S. conduct joint air drill following North Koreaâ€™s Hwasong-19 missile test](/images/us-long-range-bomber-joins-air-drill-with-south-korea--japan-MwMD.webp)

South Korea, Japan, and the United States recently conducted a [joint air drill](https://www.dw.com/en/us-long-range-bomber-joins-air-drill-with-south-korea-japan/a-70671635) in response to North Korea's test of a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) called the [Hwasong-19](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/01/world/video/north-korean-missile-launch-ldn-digvid). This drill featured a U.S. B-1B bomber escorted by fighter jets from South Korea and Japan, aiming to strengthen allied deterrence against North Korean threats. The ICBM test, which reportedly showcased advanced capabilities, is viewed as North Korea's attempt to gain U.S. attention ahead of the upcoming presidential election.

This action comes amid allegations of North Korean troop [support for Russia](https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-soldiers-russia-ukraine-war-651ac7615c3124fde657043a9193d6b1)'s operations in Ukraine. This isnâ€™t mainly that new between the US and South Korea, as the US and South Korea jointly exercise [semi-regularly](https://apnews.com/article/us-south-korea-joint-military-drills-north-13d96116dee891e28c5a92a8f0104a4d). Japan and South Korea are also the US's strongest allies.

### EU Greens oppose Stein

European Green Party members have [called on](https://www.politico.eu/article/europes-greens-tell-jill-stein-to-pull-out-of-us-election-to-defeat-trump/) U.S. Green Party candidate Jill Stein to drop her presidential bid and endorse Kamala Harris, arguing Steinâ€™s support could prevent a Trump victory. European Greens from several countries highlighted differences in values, pointing to the U.S. Greensâ€™ stance on Russia and strained relations with the global Green movement. Steinâ€™s team responded, emphasizing their commitment to grassroots democracy and rejecting the request as unprincipled interference.

The appeal shows ongoing divisions between European Greens and the U.S. Green Party, although it's likely more of a material matter of practicality. The EU is watching the US elections closely. Most mainstream parties, such as the Green Party, vastly prefer a Kamala Harris presidency, mainly because they perceive Kamala Harris to be predictable for EU-US relations.

**ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Ukraine:** Kyiv was targeted by a Russian [drone attack](https://www.dw.com/en/russian-drone-strikes-cause-destruction-in-kyiv/a-70672571) for the second night in a row, damaging buildings, roads, and power lines, but with no reported injuries. Ukrainian air defenses reportedly intercepted all drones involved, though debris caused structural damage, particularly in the Shevchenkivskyi and Holosiivskyi districts. The attacks led to air raid alerts throughout Kyiv and much of eastern Ukraine. Emergency services responded to incidents in affected areas, which include central locations with schools, businesses, and parks.

**ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ Colombia:** The 16th COP to the UNâ€™s Convention on Biological Diversity (COP16) closed [without a funding](https://www.france24.com/en/environment/20241102-cop16-ends-no-agreement-funding-roadmpa-increase-protect-species) roadmap after running overtime and losing quorum. Key issuesâ€”such as establishing a dedicated biodiversity fundâ€”remain unresolved, mainly due to disagreements between wealthy and developing nations. However, agreements were reached on establishing an Indigenous representation body and sharing benefits from genetic resources. The failure to secure further biodiversity financing follows the urgent findings that over 25% of species are at risk of extinction, pressing concerns as the Kunming-Montreal framework goals loom.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why some countries skip daylight saving?**

![Analog clock representing the concept of time changes associated with Daylight Saving Time](/images/why-does-a-lot-of-the-world-not-have-daylight-savings-time_-c2OD.webp)

Many countries worldwide do not observe [daylight saving time](https://www.statista.com/chart/24473/countries-changing-clock-daylight-savings/#:~:text=Outside%20of%20Europe%20and%20the,Zealand%20and%20parts%20of%20Australia.), far more than those that do. Most of Africa and Asia do not. Countries close to the equator often do not. The US states of Arizona and Hawaii do not. There are a lot of reasons against it. The transition disrupts sleep patterns and can increase the risk of heart attacks and workplace accidents. Studies indicate that the energy conservation benefits are negligible, often offset by higher heating and cooling costs. The time changes lead to clarity and inefficiencies, positively impacting productivity and costing businesses. Many people advocate for eliminating DST due to the inconvenience it causes. Traffic accidents increase following the springtime change, likely linked to sleep deprivation.

The reasons for this are that longer daylight hours in the evening encourage people to go out, benefiting retail businesses and the economy. With more daylight available after work hours, people are more likely to engage in outdoor activities, which can improve physical health and promote social interaction.
