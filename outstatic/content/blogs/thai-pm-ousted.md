### Thai PM Ousted by Court Over Ethics Violation, Political Turmoil Deepens

Thailand's Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin was removed from office by the Constitutional Court for an ethics violation just a week after the dissolution of the main opposition party. The ruling stemmed from Srettha appointing a Cabinet member with a tainted past. This decision leaves the country in political uncertainty, with a caretaker government in place until a new leader is chosen. The court's actions are bolstering pro-military factions, intensifying the volatile political landscape. Srettha's brief tenure was marked by economic reforms and efforts to strengthen Thailand's global standing.

Tropical Storm Ernesto has unleashed torrential rains on Puerto Rico, plunging over 300,000 residents into darkness as it threatens to escalate into a major hurricane. The storm, with winds reaching 70 mph, has caused widespread flooding, downed trees, and torn roofs across the U.S. territory. Schools and government offices remain closed, with a tropical storm warning in effect for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and surrounding areas. Ernesto is expected to intensify into a Category 3 hurricane heading toward Bermuda, posing risks of dangerous rip currents along the U.S. East Coast.

### Mpox Declared Public Health Emergency in Africa

The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared the growing spread of Mpox across the continent a public health emergency, raising concerns about potential international transmission. With over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths reported this year, primarily in Congo, the World Health Organization (WHO) is considering a similar emergency declaration. Mpox, a virus related to smallpox, has seen a 160% increase in cases across Africa, with a new, potentially more contagious variant emerging in Congo. WHO is mobilizing resources, including $1.45 million in emergency funds, to combat the outbreak, focusing on vaccination and targeted interventions.

### Germany Investigates Potential Sabotage at Military Barracks Near Cologne

Germany's Defense Ministry is investigating suspected unauthorized entry and possible sabotage at the Wahn military barracks near Cologne. The facility, which supports the military operations at Cologne/Bonn Airport, was sealed off after an incident on Tuesday night. A hole was reportedly found in the fence, and there are unconfirmed suspicions of tampering with the water supply. Water samples have been taken as part of the ongoing investigation. Military officials have taken the situation "very seriously," although specific details remain undisclosed. The barracks serves as the main base for the German government's fleet of military aircraft.

### Massive Wildfire Near Athens Burns Area Twice the Size of Manhattan

According to the EU's Copernicus Emergency Management Service, a devastating wildfire northeast of Athens has scorched 104 square kilometers (40 square miles) of land, nearly twice the size of Manhattan. The blaze, which destroyed dozens of homes and led to the death of a factory worker, was contained after an international effort involving nine countries, including Turkey. The fire follows extreme heatwaves and drought conditions across southern Europe. Over the past eight years, 450 square kilometers (174 square miles) of forest in the Attica region, encompassing Athens, have been lost to wildfires, accounting for 37% of its forested area.

### Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida Steps Down Amid Scandals

Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has announced his decision to step down, paving the way for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to select a new leader next month. This move follows a series of scandals that have eroded public trust in his administration, including controversies over unreported political donations and ties to the Unification Church. The LDP's internal leadership vote could potentially lead to Japan's first female prime minister, as several women are among the candidates. The new leader will likely face immediate challenges in restoring the party's credibility before the next general election.
