## Summary

The fall of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024 marked the end of a brutal era in Syrian history. But the collapse of one regime didn’t bring peace. It left Syria divided among rebel factions with competing visions for the future. How did the Syrian War begin, who’s involved, and what does the road ahead look like after more than a decade of civil conflict?

## How did the Syria Civil War begin?

### Syria’s post-colonial roots and sectarian tensions

Syria’s complex makeup, including Sunni Muslims, Alawites, Kurds, Druze, and Christians, has long created internal fault lines. The [Alawite minority](https://minorityrights.org/communities/alawis/), empowered by the [Assad family](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp31yj8wqqno) since 1970, ruled over a [Sunni majority](https://www.dw.com/en/syrias-ethnic-and-religious-groups-explained/a-71014065), often left politically marginalized.

### From peaceful protest to civil war in Syria

The *war in Syria* began in 2011, when peaceful pro-democracy protests during the [Arab Spring](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/17/what-is-the-arab-spring-and-how-did-it-start) were met with violent state crackdowns. Within months, peaceful demonstrations transformed into armed resistance. By late 2011, over 2,000 civilians had been killed, triggering global outrage and laying the foundation for a full-blown conflict.

## Major players in the Syrian Civil War

### Rise and fragmentation of the Free Syrian Army (FSA)

Formed by military defectors in July 2011, the [FSA](https://syriadirect.org/missing-in-action-what-happened-to-the-once-prominent-free-syrian-army/) was the first structured opposition force against Assad. Over time, internal disagreements and rising Islamist factions weakened its position, eventually leading to its rebranding under Turkish influence as the [Syrian National Army (SNA)](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/who-are-syrian-national-army).

### Turkish-backed Syrian National Army in the Syria War

The SNA, built around Turkish interests, now dominates northern Syria. Their main targets include [ISIS](https://www.rand.org/topics/the-islamic-state-terrorist-organization.html) and Kurdish forces, particularly the [YPG](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/what-is-syrian-kurdish-ypg-2023-10-05/), whom Ankara considers terrorists.

## The Kurdish role in the Syria Civil War

### Rojava and the Kurdish autonomy project

Kurdish forces, led by the YPG, took advantage of the war in Syria to form the autonomous [region of Rojava.](https://rojavainformationcenter.org/background/key-facts/) Their fight against ISIS earned US support, resulting in the formation of the [Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/military-history-and-science/syrian-democratic-forces).

### US withdrawal and Turkish offensives

In 2019, a sudden US troop withdrawal gave Turkey the green light to attack Kurdish-held areas. Displaced and isolated, Kurdish forces turned to the Assad regime for protection, altering the power balance once again.

## Jabhat al-Nusra vs. ISIS: A war within the Syrian Civil War

### The rise of Jabhat al-Nusra and extremist fragmentation

[Jabhat al-Nusra](https://www.understandingwar.org/report/jabhat-al-nusra-syria) emerged in 2012 as [al-Qaeda](https://www.britannica.com/topic/al-Qaeda)’s official arm in Syria. Under Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the group gained battlefield victories but clashed with more secular rebel groups and Western supporters.

### ISIS and the declaration of a caliphate

In 2013, [Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50200392) announced a merger between Nusra and his Iraqi forces, forming ISIS. The union sparked infighting, as both groups sought to dominate the opposition to Assad. The resulting chaos allowed ISIS to capture swaths of territory in both Syria and Iraq.

## The internationalization of the Syria War

### Proxy war in Syria: Russia, Iran, and the US

Russia and Iran propped up Assad with troops, airpower, and arms. The [US and its allies](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/proxy-conflict-paradox-why-america-and-russia-are-war-syria-182961), including France and the UK, supported moderate rebels and later led airstrikes against ISIS.

### Assad’s human rights abuses and chemical warfare

The Assad regime committed widespread atrocities, including chemical attacks, torture, and mass executions. These actions prompted limited Western intervention but stopped short of full-scale military engagement.

## Key turning points in the civil war Syrian conflict

### The collapse of ISIS in Syria

By 2019, [ISIS had lost 98% of its territory](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/publications/giga-focus/not-a-storm-in-a-teacup-the-islamic-state-after-the-caliphate). Coalition airstrikes, Kurdish-led ground assaults, and targeted killings of leadership figures, including Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, reduced the caliphate to scattered insurgents.

### Assad’s last stand and the final offensive in 2024

With his allies distracted by other global conflicts, Assad lost control of key cities like[ Aleppo and Homs](https://www.understandingwar.org/report/campaign-homs-and-aleppo). On December 8, 2024, [Damascus fell](https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/syria-civil-war-12-08-2024). Assad fled to Moscow, ending over 50 years of family rule.

## Is the Syria War over?

### Post-Assad Syria and the rise of new powers

Rebel coalitions led by [Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce313jn453zo) and the SNA now govern most of Syria. Ahmed al-Sharaa, a moderate figure, heads the transitional government and has even opened dialogue with Western leaders.

### Fragile peace and lingering ethnic tensions

Despite peace deals, violence remains. A [March 2025 massacre](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hundreds-killed-syrian-crackdown-alawite-region-war-monitor-says-2025-03-08/) of over 1,000 Alawites sparked allegations of genocide. Some claim the victims were Assad loyalists, others say innocent civilians were caught in revenge killings.

### Is this the end, or another chapter of chaos?

The future remains uncertain. Syria may follow the paths of Libya or Afghanistan, where revolution sparked temporary hope but failed to bring long-term peace. The coming months will decide whether Syria rises from the ashes or slips into a new era of instability.

## Conclusion

The end of the Assad regime brought the Syrian War into a new phase, but not an end. What comes next is a fragile experiment in rebuilding a broken country. The power vacuum has been filled by rival rebel factions, uneasy alliances, and a transitional government trying to prove its legitimacy. Ethnic tensions, militia violence, and geopolitical interference still threaten stability.

Whether Syria finally breaks the cycle of authoritarianism and proxy war depends on what happens now. With the world watching, and Syrians still fighting to define their future, this chapter could become a turning point or a tragic repeat of the past.
