## Summary

The 21st century has sparked a new race for influence in Africa. This is called the "New Scramble for Africa." Unlike the land grabs of the 19th century, today's contest involves military partnerships, resource extraction, political alliances, and economic dependence. 

At the same time, most of the focus remains on China and the US, due to their different methods of wooing African nations. One key player is overlooked, and it is Russia. It is [building ties](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/18/africa/russia-expanding-influence-in-africa-intl-cmd/index.html) with important African nations through security deals, private military contracts, disinformation efforts, and trade partnerships. This rising influence challenges Western power and changes Africa's global alliances.

## Growing Russian influence in Africa

Russia is [growing its presence in Africa](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/russias-growing-footprint-africa). This goes beyond military actions or striking headlines. It’s a careful strategy to boost global influence. The media often focuses on [Wagner Group](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Wagner-Group) activities or arms sales. However, Moscow's true aim includes diplomacy, economic investments, and [soft power](https://education.cfr.org/learn/reading/what-soft-power).

In countries such as Mali, Sudan, the Central African Republic, and Burkina Faso, Russia seeks to serve as an alternative to Western influence. They can capitalize on the area's poor history with European powers, particularly with France. This approach attracts leaders who seek to maintain power, preserve sovereignty, or evade Western pressure.

### History: Scramble for Africa

The relationship between Africa and Russia developed long before the massive decolonization of Africa in the 1960s. Throughout most of the 18th and 19th centuries, it was no secret that the USSR had been a staunch supporter of decolonization worldwide and national liberation movements. So, they focused on their immediate neighbours.

In 1885, an adventurer named [Nikolai Ashinov](https://www.aberfoylesecurity.com/?p=4849) was credited with bringing Africa to the attention of the Russian elite. Although their attempt to colonise the Red Sea failed, Russia’s desire to expand its empire did not fade. 

In 1897, the Russian Foreign Ministry sent its first diplomatic mission, laying the foundation for Russia’s relations with Africa. However, when the Russian imperialists engaged with Africans, they didn't treat them equally but as racially inferior people. 

### Timeline of relations of the Soviet Union and Russia with African countries

- **Late 18th Century:** Russia first reaches out to Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia, seeking alliances against the Ottoman Empire.

- **1869-1898:** Russia establishes formal diplomatic relations with Tunisia, Morocco, Ethiopia, and the South African Republic (also known as the Transvaal).

- **1917:** The Russian Revolution and the formation of the Soviet Union disrupted diplomatic ties with Africa.

- **1943:** The Soviet Union resumes diplomatic relations, starting with Egypt and Ethiopia.

- **Post-1945 (Post-WWII):** USSR actively supports African decolonization and national liberation movements.

- **1950s–1970s:** The USSR builds strong ties with North African countries, including Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia.

- **1960s–1980s:** The USSR strengthens its ties with socialist-oriented countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, and Guinea.

- **1970s–1980s:** Major infrastructure projects were undertaken, Including Dams, steel plants, and refineries in Egypt, Nigeria, Angola, Guinea, and other countries.

- **1970s–1980s:** Significant military assistance is provided to Egypt, Angola, and Mozambique.

  - USSR becomes dominant arms supplier:

  - 40% of Africa’s arms imports

  - Tanks: 70%, Aircraft: 40%, Helicopters: 35%

- **1991:** The dissolution of the Soviet Union disrupts ongoing relations and assistance.

- **2019:** The Russia–Africa Summit, held in Sochi, aims to revitalize modern diplomatic and economic relations between Russia and Africa.

- **2023:** The Second Russia–Africa Summit in St. Petersburg reaffirmed the importance of long-term cooperation.

### Key African nations supported by Russia 

- **Central African Republic (CAR):** The country receives security support from the Wagner group or the newly formed [Africa Corp](https://issafrica.org/iss-today/russias-africa-corps-more-than-old-wine-in-a-new-bottle). Russia has gold mining interests in the CAR. 

- **Mali:** It is a Sahel nation with Russian military backing following France's exit. The Africa Corp provides training and arms to the country.

- **Sudan:** It is rumored to have Wagner activity in this region. Sudan has several players, such as the UAE and Egypt, involved due to the trade. 

- **Libya:** It receives Russian support for factions in the civil war. What Russia gets in return is to use its military presence. This will become more relevant and useful now that it has lost its base in Syria following the fall of the Assad regime. 

- **Burkina Faso:** It is shifting its alliances from France to Russia. Russia can capitalize on the rising tide.

- **South Africa:** It is a BRICS ally. They offer political solidarity and vote in alignment with Russia in the UN on many issues. They also do naval drills with Russia.

## The role of the Wagner group and military power projection

When Russia started increasing its military influence across Africa, it often came at the expense of traditional Western powers. Russia expanded its military footprint by signing military cooperation agreements with 43 African countries, according to the European Parliament. They also provide military training and supply equipment. 

Russia offers governments a "regime survival package" in exchange for access to vital resources, according to a new report. Following the collapse of the Wagner Group after [Yevgeny Prigozhin](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/08/23/europe/wagner-chief-yevgeny-prigozhin-russia-intl)’s death, Russia’s military intelligence has taken control of these operations, aiming to [secure mining concessions](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68322230) in resource-rich countries like Mali and Niger.

### Security-for-resources trade: What Wagner offers in exchange

Wagner [has rebranded itself](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/06/11/the-wagner-group-is-leaving-mali-but-russian-mercenaries-arent-going-anywhere-a89415) as “Russia’s Expeditionary Corps" or simply “Africa Corps.” They provide African governments a key "[security-for-resources](https://www.rand.org/nsrd/projects/russian-arms-sales-and-sanctions-compliance.html)" deal. In return for protecting their regimes and fighting insurgents, Russia secures valuable resources like gold, uranium, and lithium.

This plan seeks to reduce Western control over these assets, boosting Russia’s economic and political power. These actions also strengthen Moscow's presence in mineral-rich areas. Countries such as Mali and Niger are increasingly relying on Russian mercenaries for their security.

### Human rights concerns and impact on sovereignty in Africa

The Wagner Group, also known as “Africa Corp,” has a presence in Africa that raises concerns about human rights and sovereignty issues. In the Central African Republic, Mali, and Sudan, reports link these groups to extrajudicial killings, disappearances, and torture. Civilians often experience random violence. Human Rights Watch and the UN [point to alleged war](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/03/1134447) crimes by Wagner, especially in conflict zones and mining areas.

Russia’s influence [undermines national sovereignty](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/russia-interference-undermine-democracy-africa/). Countries that hire the group often give it wide control. This includes security sectors, key infrastructure, and natural resources like gold and diamonds. In some cases, Wagner has more power than local forces, which raises questions about governance and control.

By inserting itself in fragile states, they do more than protect regimes; they alter them. The presence of these mercenaries can deter political reform, support authoritarianism, and deepen reliance on Russian military aid and perpetrate a form of colonialism and dependence.

### Strategic value of Africa: UN votes, natural resources, and global perception

Africa comprises [54 members of the UN](https://archive.uneca.org/pages/member-states). This means their votes are a valuable asset for Russia. They can help counter Western views or decisions made by the UN General Assembly. Economically, Africa has vast reserves of oil, gas, gold, and uranium. These resources are crucial for Moscow’s deals.

Culturally, Russia connects with post-colonial feelings. It presents itself as a partner instead of a colonizer. Russia is making its presence felt across Africa, employing a combination of military, diplomatic, and economic approaches.

## Russia vs the West: The geopolitical tug-of-war

Russia is increasing its presence in Africa to counter the West's influence. Moscow claims to defend sovereignty and promote non-interference. It aims to challenge the Western liberal order, especially in regions still feeling the effects of colonialism. 

This effort extends beyond military bases and mining rights. It seeks to shape beliefs, alliances, and the future of global order. Africa's strategic importance and changing politics make it a key battleground

### How Moscow positions itself as an anti-colonial alternative to the West

Russia [highlights its past support](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/09/russia-is-riding-an-anti-colonial-wave-across-africa.html) for African liberation movements. This sets it apart from Western colonial histories. Russian officials frequently discuss partnerships founded on “mutual respect” and “non-intervention.” 

This creates a clear divide between Russia's approach and that of Western powers, which focuses more on "values." This stance appeals to African leaders and citizens wary of neocolonial actions, IMF conditions, and Western moralizing.

## Impact of the Ukraine War on Africa-Russia relations

### Grain crisis and Moscow’s diplomacy

Before the war, over half of the wheat imports in 15 African countries came from both Russia and Ukraine. The conflict disrupted exports, which in turn brought a grain shortage and caused prices to skyrocket across Africa. Moscow [took advantage](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/ukraines-grain-exports-are-crucial-to-africas-food-security/#:~:text=Along%20with%20the%20sharp%20increase,the%20exports%20of%20Ukrainian%20grain.) of this crisis, offering free grain and blaming Western sanctions for the shortages.

### Mistreatment of African students

Russia took advantage of Ukraine's mistreatment and discrimination at the start of the invasion. When Russia invaded, Black students and refugees [faced racist policies](https://blog.ucs.org/chanese-forte/anti-blackness-in-europe-creates-vulnerability-during-war/#:~:text=Many%20African%20students%20reported%20a,are%20few%20Black%20Ukrainian%20nationals.) at the borders, with white Ukrainians given priority for evacuation. Many African students, studying medicine and engineering, were left stranded or mistreated. Neither Ukraine nor the EU did much to protect them, and no one was held accountable for their actions. 

There were numerous systemic biases. Many Africans learned about this and were already alienated by Ukraine, so they had no issues accepting Russian help in their countries. Despite that, Africans in Russia are also not always treated well. There are [multiple stories](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53055857) of institutional and casual racism reported by Africans residing in Russia.

### Sanctions loopholes via African ports and middlemen

Western sanctions cut Russia off from its usual markets. As a result, some African ports, particularly those with lax customs regulations, [became key routes](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/russia-skirts-western-sanctions-to-ramp-up-its-military-footprint-in-africa/articleshow/121743606.cms?from=mdr) for circumventing these restrictions. Using unclear shipping routes, reflagged ships, and middlemen, Russian goods, including oil and minerals, found new pathways into global markets. 

Some African nations, trying to remain neutral, supported this trade flow. This helped lessen the impact of sanctions and strengthened their economic ties with Moscow.

## Conclusion: A New Scramble for Africa?

Russia's growing role in Africa is a global concern. It signals a strategic shift with far-reaching effects. By offering military support, forming diplomatic ties, and sealing resource deals, Moscow is reshaping alliances. These connections often ignore Western views on democracy and human rights. This gives authoritarian regimes an alternative partnership model.

Russia’s position in Africa challenges the West's traditional dominance in the region. It disrupts multilateral efforts, such as UN peacekeeping, and deepens global divides that the Ukraine War has heightened. But Africa, once seen as a battleground for powers, is now asserting its voice.
